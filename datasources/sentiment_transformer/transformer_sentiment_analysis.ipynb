The target, as measured by the rate of infl ation\\r\\nof the consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2\\xa0percent midpoint\\r\\nof the control range of 1 to 3 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonetary policy tools\\r\\n\\uf0a7 Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight\\r\\n\\r\\nquarters—to work their way through the economy and have their\\r\\nfull effect on infl ation. For this reason, monetary policy must be\\r\\nforward-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0a7 The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes in\\r\\n\\r\\nthe target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate).2 The Bank\\r\\nalso has a range of other monetary policy tools it can use when the\\r\\npolicy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on\\r\\nthe future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases\\r\\n(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures,\\r\\nand negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these\\r\\nadditional tools would depend on the economic and fi nancial market\\r\\ncontext.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0a7 All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian goods and services through their infl uence on market\\r\\ninterest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The\\r\\nbalance between this demand and the economy’s production\\r\\ncapacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl ation\\r\\npressures in the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0a7 Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent\\r\\n\\r\\ncommunications, the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the\\r\\neconomy and infl ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on\\r\\neight pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s\\r\\noutlook are published four times each year in the Monetary Policy\\r\\nReport.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible\\r\\n\\uf0a7 Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means\\r\\nthat the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation rising above or\\r\\nfalling below the 2 percent target.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0a7 Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible. Typically, the\\r\\n\\r\\nBank seeks to return infl ation to target over a horizon of six to eight\\r\\nquarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning\\r\\ninfl ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence\\r\\nof the shocks buffeting the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitoring infl ation\\r\\n\\uf0a7\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be\\r\\nparticularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in\\r\\nindirect taxes such as the goods and services tax/harmonized sales\\r\\ntax, can cause sizable fl uctuations in CPI infl ation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0a7\\r\\n\\r\\nIn setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such\\r\\ntransitory movements in CPI infl ation and focuses on a set of “core”\\r\\ninfl ation measures that better refl ect the underlying trend of infl ation.\\r\\nIn this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the\\r\\nBank achieve the CPI infl ation target. They are not a replacement for\\r\\nCPI infl ation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0a7 The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl ation are CPI-trim,\\r\\nwhich excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given\\r\\nmonth are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to\\r\\nthe price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket\\r\\nweight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which\\r\\nuses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across\\r\\ncategories in the CPI basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the \\r\\n\\r\\nInﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website.\\r\\n\\r\\n2  The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website, describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Monetary Policy Report is available on the Bank of Canada’s website at bankofcanada.ca.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor further information, contact:\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic

Rapid increases in the number of COVID-19 infections have \\r\\nprompted governments to impose stricter containment measures and \\r\\nlockdowns (Chart\\xa01). However, an earlier-than-anticipated start to vaccination \\r\\nprograms has pulled forward the timeline for achieving broad immunity and \\r\\nimproved the outlook for growth in the medium term. Until the virus is under \\r\\ncontrol and there is no need for physical distancing, the recuperation phase \\r\\nof the economic recovery will likely remain choppy and uneven. Considerable \\r\\nfiscal and monetary stimulus continue to be required to support households \\r\\nand businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank of Canada’s economic projections depend on important \\r\\nassumptions about how the pandemic will evolve. Notably, it is assumed that \\r\\nthe vaccine rollout proceeds largely as announced by governments and that \\r\\nCanada, other advanced economies and China achieve broad immunity by \\r\\nthe end of 2021. Emerging-market economies (EMEs) are assumed to obtain \\r\\nbroad immunity by mid-2022. Uncertainty about the path of the virus and its \\r\\neffects on economic behaviour remains elevated, although less so than at \\r\\nthe onset of the pandemic when the prospects for effective vaccines were \\r\\nunclear. The outlook continues to be highly conditional on the timeline for \\r\\nrolling out vaccines and on the path of the virus and its new variants.\\r\\n\\r\\nChart 1: COVID-19 is spreading aggressively in advanced economies\\r\\nDaily new cases per million people, 7-day moving average\\r\\n\\r\\na.

Growth in the first quarter \\r\\nof 2021 is expected to be negative. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 Unemployment in Canada remains elevated, particularly for workers in \\r\\nhigh-contact service industries. These workers will once again be the \\r\\nhardest hit by the lockdown measures.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 With vaccines being rolled out earlier than anticipated, the recuperation \\r\\nin the Canadian economy is now more secure, and medium-term growth \\r\\nis forecast to be stronger. Nevertheless, considerable economic slack \\r\\nremains in the economy, and a complete recovery will take some time. As \\r\\na result, inflation is not anticipated to return sustainably to its 2 percent \\r\\ntarget until 2023.1\\r\\n\\r\\n1 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this Report, the projection horizon has been extended by one year to include 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nGlOBAl eCONOMy  3 \\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal economy\\r\\nGlobal economy\\r\\n\\r\\nMany countries are still struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19. \\r\\nStricter containment measures and lockdowns are weighing on the near-\\r\\nterm outlook, particularly in advanced economies. Policy continues to play \\r\\nan important role in helping households and businesses cope with the \\r\\npandemic. US authorities recently passed legislation to provide additional \\r\\nfiscal stimulus to address the current economic weakness and hardship \\r\\nin their country. Accommodative monetary policy remains in place in most \\r\\nadvanced economies, and several central banks—including the European \\r\\nCentral Bank—have announced further easing since the October Report. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the projection horizon, the early arrival of vaccines implies faster \\r\\nmedium-term economic growth in advanced economies and a stronger \\r\\noutlook for global growth compared with the October Report. Global financial \\r\\nmarkets and commodity prices have reacted positively to the vaccines’ \\r\\narrival and to improving prospects for global growth. The Bank projects that \\r\\nthe pandemic’s direct economic effects will dissipate over 2021 and 2022 \\r\\nas countries obtain broad immunity. The pandemic will, however, have more \\r\\nlasting negative effects. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, global growth is expected to average about 5 percent per \\r\\nyear in 2021 and 2022 before slowing to about 4 percent in 2023 \\r\\n(Table 1). The projected level of global gross domestic product (GDP) by \\r\\nthe end of 2022 is about 2¼\\xa0percent higher than in the October Report. \\r\\n\\r\\nTable 1: Projection for global economic growth\\r\\n\\r\\nShare of real \\r\\nglobal GDP* \\r\\n\\r\\n(percent)\\r\\n\\r\\nProjected growth† (percent) \\r\\n\\r\\n2019\\r\\n\\r\\n2020\\r\\n\\r\\n2021\\r\\n\\r\\n2022\\r\\n\\r\\n2023\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\n12\\r\\n\\r\\n16\\r\\n\\r\\n2.7\\r\\n\\r\\n2.0\\r\\n\\r\\n5.0 (3.1)\\r\\n\\r\\n1.9 (1.9)\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3 (1.3)\\r\\n\\r\\n4.4 (4.9)\\r\\n\\r\\n4.5 (2.4)\\r\\n\\r\\n3.9 (3.4)\\r\\n\\r\\n0.3 (0.7)\\r\\n\\r\\n2.8 (3.7)\\r\\n\\r\\n6.0 (6.2)\\r\\n\\r\\n2.2 (2.2)\\r\\n\\r\\n-7.1 (-8.0)\\r\\n\\r\\n-3.5 (-3.6)\\r\\n\\r\\n-5.2 (-5.7)\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States\\r\\nEuro area\\r\\nJapan\\r\\nChina\\r\\nOil-importing EMEs‡\\r\\nRest of the world§\\r\\nWorld\\r\\n3.9\\r\\n* GDP shares are based on International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates of the purchasing-power-parity \\r\\n†  Numbers in parentheses are projections used in the previous Report.\\r\\n ‡ The oil-importing emerging-market economies (EMEs) grouping excludes China.

The United States is an exception. \\r\\nUS economic activity has been more resilient to the pandemic, largely due \\r\\nto less-restrictive containment measures and strong fiscal and monetary \\r\\nstimulus. As a result, the US output gap is projected to close near the end of \\r\\n2021, with inflation reaching 2 percent in late 2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial market conditions are highly accommodative\\r\\nGlobal equity prices have risen in response to positive vaccine \\r\\ndevelopments, recently bringing several indexes to record highs (Chart\\xa02). \\r\\nSovereign bond yields continue to be very low for most advanced economies, \\r\\nconsistent with accommodative monetary policies. However, nominal US \\r\\n10-year bond yields have increased about 30 basis points since the October \\r\\nReport, largely reflecting increases in expected inflation and the inflation risk \\r\\npremium. US yields have risen on an improved growth outlook, partly related \\r\\nto additional US fiscal support. \\r\\n\\r\\nConditions in corporate and EME bond markets also reflect supportive \\r\\nfinancial conditions.

Data for housing, business investment and \\r\\ninternational trade, however, show relatively robust recoveries. Although \\r\\nunemployment has been declining, December’s job losses indicate that the \\r\\nresurgence of the virus is affecting the labour market. The unemployment \\r\\nrate has declined and is now 6.7 percent, but the long-term unemployment \\r\\nrate has risen to 2.5\\xa0percent (Chart 3). More than 10.7 million people remain \\r\\nunemployed.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS authorities have agreed to provide additional fiscal stimulus worth \\r\\nabout US$900 billion. Distribution of the funds is expected to begin in the \\r\\nfirst quarter of 2021, with about half the amount disbursed by mid-2021. \\r\\nUS\\xa0GDP is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2021, led by consumption that \\r\\nis supported by fiscal stimulus, the easing of containment measures and the \\r\\nrollout of vaccines. Strong demand and accommodative financial conditions \\r\\nare anticipated to support the recoveries in business and residential \\r\\ninvestment. Growth is projected to slow over 2022 and 2023 as the recovery \\r\\nprogresses and the effects of fiscal stimulus fade. \\r\\n\\r\\nBank staff estimate that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on the \\r\\neconomy and will remove about 1¼ percent from the level of US potential \\r\\nGDP by the end of 2022. Households will likely remain somewhat cautious, \\r\\nkeeping the saving rate elevated compared with historical averages. An \\r\\nincreased desire for precautionary savings is expected to dampen demand \\r\\nthrough 2023. \\r\\n\\r\\nCompared with the October Report, US GDP is revised up by about \\r\\n2½\\xa0percent by the fourth quarter of 2022. This change is due to the additional \\r\\nfiscal stimulus, earlier-than-expected availability of vaccines and easier \\r\\nfinancial conditions.

Deteriorating economic conditions and slowing inflation prompted the \\r\\nEuropean Central Bank to announce additional easing in December. The \\r\\nrecovery is expected to pick up in mid-2021 as containment measures ease \\r\\nand vaccines are widely distributed. The resolution of uncertainty around \\r\\nBrexit negotiations also removes some drag on growth. The Bank projects \\r\\nGDP growth in the euro area of about 4½ percent in 2021 and 2022, as policy \\r\\nsupports growth and the direct effects of the pandemic diminish. The early \\r\\ndeployment of vaccines has considerably strengthened the medium-term \\r\\noutlook for the euro area relative to the October Report. \\r\\n\\r\\nChina’s strong economic recovery continues \\r\\nChina’s recovery continues to broaden. Consumption is strengthening, \\r\\nand the country is experiencing robust expansions in industrial production, \\r\\nexports and investment. Chinese exports will likely continue to benefit from \\r\\nresilience in global demand for goods. Growth is expected to be about \\r\\n8½\\xa0percent in 2021 and then to slow in 2022 and 2023 to be broadly in line \\r\\nwith potential output growth. With the virus relatively well controlled and \\r\\neconomic activity returning to normal, China is less affected than other \\r\\nregions by the early arrival of vaccines, and the Bank’s forecast for GDP \\r\\ngrowth is largely unchanged from the October Report. Reduced trade \\r\\ntensions and stronger foreign demand support somewhat greater growth, but \\r\\nhigher oil prices and the appreciation of the Chinese currency since October \\r\\nlargely offset those effects. Recently, credit conditions have also tightened \\r\\nsomewhat, following some high-profile corporate bond defaults.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery in emerging-market economies is strong\\r\\nRecent data indicate a robust economic recovery in many EMEs, likely \\r\\nreflecting less severe impacts of the virus than had been initially feared. \\r\\nHowever, the rollout of vaccines is assumed to occur more slowly in most \\r\\nEMEs than in advanced economies. As a result, the direct effects from the \\r\\npandemic are expected to take longer to dissipate. Economic activity in oil-\\r\\nimporting EMEs is projected to grow by 6½ percent in 2021 and to increase \\r\\nby about 5 percent on average in 2022 and 2023, as direct effects from \\r\\nthe pandemic ease and foreign demand strengthens. The outlook for oil-\\r\\nimporting EMEs is revised up considerably from the October Report. This \\r\\nupward revision is based mostly on stronger-than-expected recent data—\\r\\nparticularly for India and emerging Europe—as well as on easier financial \\r\\nconditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the rest-of-world group, several countries have reimposed containment \\r\\nmeasures. This is anticipated to restrain activity in the near term. Growth \\r\\nis forecast to be 2 percent in 2021 and to pick up to 4 percent in 2022, as \\r\\nvaccines reduce the need for physical distancing. Oil prices remain below \\r\\ntheir pre-pandemic levels, weighing on the outlook for oil exporters, which \\r\\nmake up most of this group. However, recent increases in oil prices and \\r\\nreduced uncertainty following the Brexit agreement contribute to upward \\r\\nrevisions to growth relative to the October Report. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nGlOBAl eCONOMy  7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCommodity prices have risen \\r\\nPrices of Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil have averaged about \\r\\nUS$50 per barrel recently, roughly US$10 higher than assumed in the \\r\\nOctober Report (Chart 4).

Changes in supply also explain some of the recent \\r\\nprice increase. Saudi Arabia announced that it will cut its oil production \\r\\nin February and March 2021. Other members of the Organization of the \\r\\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC oil producers \\r\\nagreed to maintain production close to January levels.

Progress toward broad \\r\\nimmunity both globally and in Canada will support business investment and \\r\\nexports, as pandemic-related uncertainty declines and business confidence \\r\\nimproves.

In 2023, \\r\\nthe economy is projected to grow at around 2½ percent. The medium-term \\r\\noutlook is stronger than in the October Report because of the positive effects \\r\\nfrom vaccines, greater fiscal stimulus, stronger foreign demand and higher \\r\\ncommodity prices.

Thus, while the output gap is expected to \\r\\nclose in 2023, the timing is particularly uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer price index (CPI) inflation has risen from its 2020 lows.

Th  e Bank regularly \\r\\nreviews these assumptions and assesses the sensitivity of \\r\\nthe economic projection to them. Th  e key inputs into the \\r\\nBank’s projection are as follows:\\r\\n \\x83 An eﬀ ective vaccine rollout leads to broad immunity \\r\\n\\r\\nby the end of 2021 in Canada, other advanced \\r\\neconomies and China and by mid-2022 in other \\r\\nemerging-market economies.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 In Canada, several provinces have either tightened or \\r\\nextended containment measures. Th  e Bank’s outlook \\r\\nassumes that the most severe of these measures \\r\\nwill be eased in February. Reduced restrictions are \\r\\nassumed to remain in place thereaft er, gradually \\r\\neasing as the pandemic recedes. Th  e duration and \\r\\nintensity of restrictions depend on the path of the \\r\\nvirus.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. \\r\\nTh  e per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be \\r\\n$50 for Brent and West Texas Intermediate and $35 \\r\\nfor Western Canadian Select, about $10 and $5 higher, \\r\\nrespectively, than assumed in the October Report.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 By convention, the Bank does not forecast the \\r\\n\\r\\nexchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. Th  e \\r\\nCanadian dollar is assumed to remain at 78 cents US \\r\\nover the projection horizon, close to its recent average \\r\\nand above the 76 cents US assumed in the October \\r\\nReport.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 Th  e pandemic and related containment measures \\r\\nhave persistent and temporary negative eﬀ ects on \\r\\nthe Canadian economy.1\\r\\n \\uf0ea Th  e Bank’s assessment of the growth of potential \\r\\noutput, a longer-term concept, looks through the \\r\\nshort-lived impacts of containment measures. Th  e \\r\\nBank estimates that persistent scarring eﬀ ects \\r\\nof the pandemic on the labour force, investment \\r\\n\\r\\n1  As in the October Report, the Bank makes the distinction between supply and \\r\\n\\r\\npotential output in the near term to account for the relatively short-lived nature \\r\\nof some of the decrease in supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nand productivity will weigh on potential output \\r\\ngrowth (for details, see Appendix 1 of the October \\r\\nReport). Over 2021–23, potential output growth is \\r\\nassumed to average about 1.4 percent per year in \\r\\nthe projection.2\\r\\n\\r\\n \\uf0ea Containment measures implemented by \\r\\n\\r\\ngovernments are having important short-term \\r\\neﬀ ects on the supply of goods and services. In \\r\\nparticular, supply fell sharply in 2020 when some \\r\\nbusinesses were forced to temporarily suspend \\r\\nor reduce operations. Th  e eﬀ ects of containment \\r\\nmeasures on supply are expected to remain \\r\\nsignifi cant in early 2021 and to dissipate by the \\r\\nend of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\uf0ea Estimates of supply can be obtained by combining \\r\\n\\r\\nthe estimates of the temporary eﬀ ects of the \\r\\ncontainment measures with the assessment of \\r\\npotential output. Th  e Bank estimates that the \\r\\noutput gap—the diﬀ erence between GDP and \\r\\nsupply—was about -3.75 to -2.75 percent in the \\r\\nfourth quarter of 2020, somewhat narrower than \\r\\nthe revised range of -4.5 to -3.5 percent in the \\r\\nthird quarter.3\\r\\n\\r\\n \\x83 Th  e neutral nominal policy rate is defi ned as the real \\r\\nrate consistent with output remaining sustainably at \\r\\nits potential and with inﬂ ation at target, on an ongoing \\r\\nbasis, plus 2 percent for inﬂ ation. It is a medium- to \\r\\nlong-term equilibrium concept. For Canada, the \\r\\neconomic projection is based on an assumption that \\r\\nthe neutral rate is at the midpoint of the estimated \\r\\nrange of 1.75 to 2.75 percent. Th  is range was last \\r\\nreassessed in the October Report. \\r\\n\\r\\n2  Th  e assumptions regarding potential output and potential output growth are \\r\\n\\r\\n3 \\r\\n\\r\\nhigher than in the October Report. Th  is change reﬂ ects positive historical \\r\\nrevisions, stronger expected investment, higher immigration targets and \\r\\nreduced scarring eﬀ ects from the pandemic. \\r\\nIn the October Report, the output gap in the third quarter of 2020 was assumed \\r\\nto be between -4 and -3 percent. Historical data revisions and new data \\r\\npublished since the October Report have reduced the level of GDP and raised \\r\\nestimates of the level of potential output for that quarter. As a result, the output \\r\\ngap in the third quarter of 2020 is estimated to be roughly 0.5 percentage \\r\\npoints more negative than assumed in October.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nCANADIAN eCONOMy  13 \\r\\n\\r\\nChart 7: The pandemic has induced a shift in housing preferences toward \\r\\n\\r\\nsingle-family homes\\r\\nMultiple Listing Service Home Price Index, year-over-year percentage change, monthly data\\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n25\\r\\n\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\n10\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n-5\\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n100\\r\\n\\r\\n80\\r\\n\\r\\n60\\r\\n\\r\\n40\\r\\n\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n-20\\r\\n\\r\\n-40\\r\\n\\r\\n-60\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n2010\\r\\n\\r\\n2012\\r\\n\\r\\n2014\\r\\n\\r\\n2016\\r\\n\\r\\n2018\\r\\n\\r\\n2020\\r\\n\\r\\n Apartments\\r\\n\\r\\n Single-family homes\\r\\n\\r\\nSources: Canadian Real Estate Association and \\r\\nBank of Canada calculations \\r\\n\\r\\nLast observation: December 2020\\r\\n\\r\\nChart 8: Business lending conditions have remained relatively favourable\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior Loan Offi cer Survey business lending conditions, balance of opinion, quarterly data\\r\\n\\r\\nTightening\\r\\n\\r\\nEasing\\r\\n\\r\\n2006\\r\\n\\r\\n2008\\r\\n\\r\\n2010\\r\\n\\r\\n2012\\r\\n\\r\\n2014\\r\\n\\r\\n2016\\r\\n\\r\\n2018\\r\\n\\r\\n2020\\r\\n\\r\\n Non-price\\r\\n\\r\\n Price\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Balance of opinion means the percentage of respondents reporting tightening business lending conditions \\r\\nminus those reporting easing business lending conditions.

The level of housing activity should \\r\\nremain elevated into the start of 2021, supported by low borrowing rates and \\r\\nresilient disposable incomes.

Momentum entering the quarter \\r\\nwas stronger than expected in the October Report, and this additional \\r\\nstrength continued well into the quarter. Meanwhile, containment measures \\r\\nhave been tightened by more than was anticipated, leading to additional \\r\\nweakness in the first quarter of this year. If restrictions are reduced later in \\r\\nthe first quarter, a sharp bounce-back is expected in the second quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant excess capacity remains \\r\\nWeaker growth at the end of 2020 and in early 2021 will exacerbate an \\r\\nalready-difficult labour market for many Canadian workers. Pandemic-related \\r\\njob losses were around 640,000 in December, substantially worse than at \\r\\nthe peak of the 2008–09 recession. The unemployment rate declined from \\r\\n13.7\\xa0percent at its peak in May 2020 to 8.6\\xa0percent in December. Meanwhile, \\r\\nafter rising sharply in recent months, the long-term unemployment rate \\r\\nreached 2.4 percent in December, up about 1.5\\xa0percentage points from May \\r\\n(Chart\\xa09). The large number of long-term unemployed workers is a serious \\r\\nconcern because their skills may erode and their attachment to the labour \\r\\nforce may decrease.\\r\\n\\r\\nVulnerable workers are expected to be the most adversely affected by recent \\r\\nrestrictions. In December, employment of low-wage workers was only about \\r\\n80 percent of its pre-pandemic level (Chart\\xa010). Youth, women and low-\\r\\nwage employees are more likely to work in severely affected sectors, such as \\r\\naccommodation and food services. A further challenge is that unemployed \\r\\nworkers from these sectors typically move among jobs that are also currently \\r\\nat risk. For example, from 2010 to 2019, almost 70 percent of laid-off workers \\r\\nin accommodation and food services who found work within a year moved to \\r\\na different job within the same industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, some labour market developments have been positive. Despite \\r\\nthe ongoing challenges in some sectors, overall job gains were unexpectedly \\r\\nresilient to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in October and November. \\r\\n\\r\\nChart 9: Long-term unemployment is increasing in Canada\\r\\n\\r\\nMonthly data\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\n10\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of people\\r\\n3,000\\r\\n\\r\\n2,500\\r\\n\\r\\n2,000\\r\\n\\r\\n1,500\\r\\n\\r\\n1,000\\r\\n\\r\\n500\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n2000\\r\\n\\r\\n2005\\r\\n\\r\\n2010\\r\\n\\r\\n2015\\r\\n\\r\\n2020\\r\\n\\r\\n Long-term unemployment rate (left scale)\\r\\n Total unemployment rate (left scale)\\r\\n\\r\\n Long-term unemployed people (right scale) \\r\\n Rest of unemployed people (right scale)\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Long-term unemployed people are those who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more. “Rest of \\r\\nunemployed people” includes those for whom the duration of unemployment is unknown.\\r\\nSources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations \\r\\n\\r\\nLast observation: December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cBANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nCANADIAN eCONOMy  15 \\r\\n\\r\\nChart 10: Impacts on employment remain uneven\\r\\nMonthly d ata\\r\\n\\r\\na.

Prices for some components that \\r\\nfell sharply because of weak demand early in the pandemic have continued \\r\\nto hold down inflation.

They have been \\r\\nhigher than CPI inflation because the core measures are less influenced by \\r\\nlarge price declines in a small number of components, such as gasoline and \\r\\ntravel-related services.\\r\\n\\r\\nCPI inflation has been stronger than expected in recent months. While the \\r\\nunanticipated strength was relatively broad-based, it was driven partly by \\r\\nstronger consumer demand for some goods. As well, increased input costs \\r\\nrelated to the pandemic may be playing a role. For example, shelter costs \\r\\nwere higher than anticipated, partly reflecting higher-than-expected prices \\r\\nof new homes due to higher prices for building materials. These factors will \\r\\nlikely persist in the coming months and are contributing to a stronger near-\\r\\nterm outlook for inflation. In addition, by March, gasoline prices will be well \\r\\nabove their lows of a year earlier, even if they do not change from their \\r\\ncurrent level. This will significantly boost inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong growth and a protracted recuperation are \\r\\nexpected\\r\\nGrowth is expected to be around 4 percent in 2021 and close to 5 percent \\r\\nin 2022, as the economy recovers from the significant economic impacts \\r\\nof the pandemic (Chart\\xa012). The Bank anticipates that quarterly growth \\r\\nrates will continue to be choppy. This is because suppressed spending from \\r\\ncontainment restrictions in one quarter is likely to be followed by a bounce in \\r\\nanother quarter after measures are eased. The choppiness should diminish \\r\\nover time as the share of the immunized population increases and economic \\r\\nmomentum becomes more sustained.

Vaccinations have begun sooner than expected, shortening \\r\\nthe Bank’s assumed timeline for broad immunity by roughly six months, to the \\r\\nend of 2021. As a result, economic activity comes back more quickly and the \\r\\nprojection includes less scarring for businesses (e.g., fewer bankruptcies) and \\r\\nfor workers (e.g., less erosion of skills). Fiscal stimulus, foreign demand and \\r\\ncommodity prices are also anticipated to be stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiscal policy is expected to continue to support the recovery. Federal and \\r\\nprovincial measures introduced since early 2020—including direct spending, \\r\\ntransfers and credit measures—amount to around 25 percent of nominal GDP \\r\\nfrom the fourth quarter of 2019. Additional stimulus of between $70 billion and \\r\\n$100 billion over three years was announced in the federal Fall Economic \\r\\nStatement in 2020. While details have yet to be released, the government \\r\\nindicated that the level of stimulus will support growth once the pandemic has \\r\\nended, with the amount of stimulus dependent on the strength of the recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic will likely have lasting effects on potential output, but these \\r\\ncannot be estimated with precision. How long changes in consumer and \\r\\nbusiness behaviour may last also remains unclear. These factors contribute \\r\\nto uncertainty in estimates of the output gap.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumption is forecast to underpin the recovery\\r\\nIn the Bank’s projection, several factors influence consumption. These \\r\\ninclude the easing of containment measures and the recovery of consumer \\r\\nconfidence, as well as elevated levels of disposable income. Over the \\r\\nprojection horizon, recovery of the labour market contributes to higher \\r\\nlabour income, while government payments to households gradually decline. \\r\\nMonetary policy is expected to continue to support spending, particularly for \\r\\ndurable goods (such as motor vehicles) and housing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c \\r\\n\\r\\n18  CANADIAN eCONOMy\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nChart 13: The savings rate should gradually return close to its pre-pandemic \\r\\n\\r\\nlevel as households remain cautious\\r\\nNominal quarterly data\\r\\n\\r\\nIndex\\r\\n120\\r\\n\\r\\n110\\r\\n\\r\\n100\\r\\n\\r\\n90\\r\\n\\r\\n80\\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n30\\r\\n\\r\\n25\\r\\n\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\n10\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n2019\\r\\n\\r\\n2020\\r\\n\\r\\n2021\\r\\n\\r\\n2022\\r\\n\\r\\n2023\\r\\n\\r\\n Household consumption (index: 2019Q4 = 100, left scale)\\r\\n Disposable income (index: 2019Q4 = 100, left scale)\\r\\n Savings rate (right scale)\\r\\n Average savings rate (2000–19, right scale)\\r\\n\\r\\nSources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations and projections\\r\\n\\r\\nWith consumption still well below its pre-pandemic level, the drag from \\r\\nphysical distancing should fade, which should contribute to strong growth of \\r\\naround 4¼ percent on average in 2021 and 2022. An important driver of this \\r\\ngrowth is the anticipated rebound in consumer spending on services, such as \\r\\nhospitality and travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank assumes that households do not boost their consumption spending \\r\\nusing the savings that many have accumulated since the start of the \\r\\npandemic. The savings rate is anticipated to decline but remain somewhat \\r\\nhigher than its pre-pandemic level (Chart\\xa013). This assumption is consistent \\r\\nwith lasting effects on consumer behaviour, such as heightened demand \\r\\nfor precautionary savings. For example, nearly half of respondents to the \\r\\nCanadian Survey of Consumer Expectations in the fourth quarter of 2020 \\r\\nreported that they plan to keep most of their extra savings as a safeguard. \\r\\nHowever, this cautiousness may not persist, leading to an upside risk to the \\r\\nconsumption outlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nHousing market activity is expected to soften gradually from current elevated \\r\\nlevels. In 2021, demand for single-family homes will likely continue to outpace \\r\\nsupply, supported by low financing costs and an improving labour market. \\r\\nAfter 2021, the impact on demand from shifts in housing-related preferences \\r\\nis expected to fade.

While it is unlikely that pipeline capacity will constrain exports in the \\r\\nnear term, transportation concerns could resurface as an impediment to oil \\r\\nexports over the medium term.\\r\\n\\r\\nImport growth over the projection horizon will depend on the timing of the \\r\\nrecovery in demand for goods and services. The growth in imports picks up \\r\\nstrongly in 2021, reflecting the rapid recovery in demand for retail goods, \\r\\na large share of which are imported. By 2022, import growth softens as \\r\\nconsumption growth is boosted by the rebound in services, which are mainly \\r\\nprovided domestically. The higher level of the Canadian dollar will also \\r\\nincrease competition from imports.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness investment strengthens as uncertainty \\r\\nrecedes\\r\\nOutside the oil and gas sector, investment is expected to pick up significantly \\r\\nin 2021 from current low levels. Less uncertainty should allow firms to move \\r\\nahead with their investment plans.

Coupled with the maturing of shorter-term assets, \\r\\nthe recalibrated QE program has resulted in a somewhat \\r\\nlonger overall maturity structure of the Bank’s balance \\r\\nsheet. Th  e total balance sheet now has 18 percent of \\r\\nassets maturing in 10 years or more, compared with \\r\\n15 percent at the time of the October Report.\\r\\nGovernment of Canada (GoC) bonds now make up \\r\\n55 percent of the assets on the Bank’s balance sheet. \\r\\nAt the same time, the Bank’s ownership of the total \\r\\namount of these bonds outstanding has increased \\r\\nfrom 32 percent in October to 36 percent.2 Th  is share \\r\\nincludes Bank purchases at auctions that are part of the \\r\\nBank’s standard practice as well as QE purchases. As a \\r\\npercentage of gross domestic product, the government \\r\\nbond holdings of some central banks are smaller than \\r\\nthose of the Bank of Canada, while, for others, holdings \\r\\nare larger (Chart 2-B).\\r\\nTh  e balance sheet has grown from $530 billion in October \\r\\nto $548 billion. Th  is increase has occurred because the \\r\\npurchases of GoC bonds have outpaced the maturing \\r\\nof other assets associated with operations to support \\r\\nmarket functioning. Th  e pace at which these other assets \\r\\nare maturing will accelerate over the next three months. \\r\\nMore than $140 billion of treasury bills and enhanced \\r\\n\\r\\nterm repos will mature during this period, and the Bank’s \\r\\nbalance sheet will likely decrease as a result. However, \\r\\nthe size of the Bank’s balance sheet on its own is not an \\r\\nappropriate indicator of the total amount of monetary \\r\\nstimulus being provided. Rather, the degree of exceptional \\r\\nmonetary stimulus is linked to QE operations. \\r\\nIn assessing the degree of exceptional monetary \\r\\nstimulus, it is important to consider the ﬂ ow of GoC bond \\r\\npurchases, the maturity of those purchases and the \\r\\ntotal stock of the purchases. Th  e ﬂ ow of purchases puts \\r\\nongoing downward pressure on yields, which reduces \\r\\nborrowing costs for households and businesses. Th  e \\r\\nmaturity of purchases matters because when they are \\r\\ntilted toward longer-maturity securities, more term risk is \\r\\nremoved from markets.

The outlook \\r\\ncould be stronger than in the base-case projection if containment measures \\r\\nresult in less drag on economic growth than assumed. This would imply \\r\\nstronger household spending and business investment. Similarly, the outlook \\r\\ncould be weaker than projected if households become more cautious or if more \\r\\nbusinesses are pushed into bankruptcy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also considerable uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the \\r\\npandemic. GDP and potential output could be stronger than in the base \\r\\ncase if scarring effects are more limited than assumed. In contrast, potential \\r\\nGDP growth could be more negatively affected if the pandemic is longer or \\r\\nharsher than assumed, likely leading to more restructuring and reallocation of \\r\\nresources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic may also accelerate long-term structural trends that have been \\r\\nunderway for some time. Rapid acceleration in e-commerce may lead to less \\r\\ndemand for retail space. Success with remote work could lead to reduced \\r\\ndemand for office space. Experience with virtual meetings may imply less \\r\\nbusiness travel. These types of structural changes tend to affect both \\r\\ndemand and supply, with demand effects usually having an impact sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the course of the pandemic proceeds as assumed in the base-case \\r\\nprojection, the Bank sees a number of other upside and downside risks to the \\r\\noutlook for inflation. The forecast risks to the economic outlook and inflation \\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n26  RISKS tO the INFlAtION OUtlOOK  \\r\\n\\r\\nBANK OF CANADA  •  MONetARy POlICy RePORt  •  JANUARy 2021\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nare viewed as roughly balanced. Downside risks pose a greater concern \\r\\nbecause inflation is currently low and the policy rate is at its estimated \\r\\neffective lower bound. Key risks include the following.\\r\\n\\r\\n(i)  Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)\\r\\n\\r\\nHousehold savings have increased dramatically since the pandemic \\r\\nbegan, particularly for higher-income households. This likely reflects \\r\\nfewer opportunities to spend and increased precautionary savings. \\r\\nIf households spend their accumulated savings, rather than using \\r\\nthem to pay down debt or invest in financial assets, then consumption \\r\\nand residential investment could be stronger than in the base-case \\r\\nprojection. This would imply less disinflationary pressure.  \\r\\n\\r\\n(ii)  Additional fiscal stimulus in the United States (↑)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new US administration has proposed additional fiscal stimulus \\r\\nover the $900 billion approved since the October Report. If authorities \\r\\nreach an agreement to enact substantial additional fiscal support, US \\r\\ngrowth could be materially stronger than in the base-case projection. \\r\\nThis would further support Canadian export growth, the prices of our \\r\\ncommodity exports and investment activity. \\r\\n\\r\\n(iii) Persistent cost pressures (↑)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic is disrupting business operations across all sectors of \\r\\nthe economy. For example, to avoid similar supply-chain difficulties in \\r\\nthe future, many manufacturing firms will likely change their production \\r\\nprocesses, including re-sourcing their inputs or production and \\r\\nincreasing their resiliency. Thus, the economic recovery could take \\r\\nplace against a backdrop of structural changes to global value chains \\r\\nand production process, resulting in more persistent cost pressures. \\r\\n\\r\\n(iv) Corporate financial stress (↓)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn sectors hard hit by COVID-19, the longer the pandemic lasts, the \\r\\ngreater the number of businesses that may face cash flow pressures. \\r\\nThis increases the risks of a sudden wave of insolvencies and \\r\\nbankruptcies, a sharp tightening in credit conditions and a reduction \\r\\nin bank lending, with negative implications for growth. Meanwhile, \\r\\nin sectors that are less affected by the pandemic, businesses have \\r\\nincreased their cash buffers. These businesses may be more \\r\\nconservative in their investment decisions because of lingering \\r\\nuncertainty, potential structural changes and the perception that \\r\\ndisruptive events have become more likely.\\r\\n\\r\\n(v)  Stronger Canadian dollar (↓)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian dollar has risen steadily since October, reaching its highest \\r\\nlevel since early 2018. This increase has been driven primarily by broad-\\r\\nbased weakness of the US dollar. Appreciation of the Canadian dollar \\r\\ncreates direct downward pressure on inflation by lowering the prices of \\r\\nimports. Further appreciation of the Canadian dollar could slow output \\r\\ngrowth by reducing the competitiveness of Canadian exports and import-\\r\\ncompeting production. Slower output growth would also imply more \\r\\ndisinflationary pressures. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c\""

For this reason, \\r\\nmonetary policy must be forward-looking . \\r\\n\\r\\n•  Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent \\r\\n\\r\\ncommunications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-\\r\\ntive on the forces at work on the economy and their \\r\\n\\r\\nimplications for infl ation . the Monetary Policy Report is a \\r\\nkey element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-\\r\\ncally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, \\r\\nand full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to \\r\\nthe projection, are published four times per year in the \\r\\nMonetary Policy Report .\\r\\n\\r\\nInfl ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ exible\\r\\n•  Canada’s infl ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which \\r\\nmeans that the Bank is equally concerned about infl ation \\r\\nrising above or falling below the 2 per cent target . \\r\\n\\r\\n•  Canada’s infl ation-targeting framework is ﬂ exible . \\r\\n\\r\\ntypically, the Bank seeks to return infl ation to target over \\r\\na horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most \\r\\nappropriate horizon for returning infl ation to target will \\r\\nvary depending on the nature and persistence of the \\r\\nshocks buﬀ eting the economy .\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitoring infl ation\\r\\n• \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is \\r\\ncaused by fl uctuations in the prices of certain volatile \\r\\ncomponents (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in \\r\\nindirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a \\r\\nset of “core” infl ation measures, most importantly the \\r\\nCPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com-\\r\\nponents and the eﬀ ect of indirect taxes on the remaining \\r\\ncomponents . these “core” measures allow the Bank to \\r\\n“look through” temporary price movements and focus on \\r\\nthe underlying trend of infl ation . In this sense, core infl a-\\r\\ntion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank \\r\\nachieve the total CPI infl ation target . It is not a replace-\\r\\nment for it .\\r\\n\\r\\n1  See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target (8 november 2011) and\\r\\n\\r\\nRenewal of the Inﬂ ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website .\\r\\n\\r\\n2  When interest rates are at the zero lower bound, additional monetary easing to achieve the infl ation target can be provided through three unconven-\\r\\ntional instruments: (i) a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate; (ii) quantitative easing; and (iii) credit easing . these instruments \\r\\nand the principles guiding their use are described in the annex to the april 2009 Monetary Policy Report .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Monetary Policy Report is available on the Bank of Canada’s website at bankofcanada.ca.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor further information, contact:\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Information\\r\\nCommunications Department\\r\\nBank of Canada\\r\\n234 Laurier Avenue West\\r\\nOttawa, Ontario  K1A 0G9\\r\\n\\r\\nTelephone: 613 782-8111; \\r\\n1 800 303-1282 (toll free in North America)\\r\\nEmail: info@bankofcanada.ca; Website: bankofcanada.ca \\r\\n\\r\\nISSN 1201-8783 (Print)\\r\\nISSN 1490-1234 (Online)\\r\\n© Bank of Canada 2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cMonetary Policy Report\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:  \\r\\nStephen S.

Nevertheless, these factors can only \\r\\npartially explain the broad-based weakness in the first quarter, suggesting \\r\\nthat there is less underlying momentum in the U.S. economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic activity in the euro area continued to expand modestly in the first \\r\\nquarter. Growth was uneven, with the strength in Germany offset by con-\\r\\ntracting or stagnant activity in many other countries. In contrast, real GDP in \\r\\nJapan jumped sharply in the first quarter, but this reflected a pulling forward \\r\\nof growth before the April increase in the value-added tax from 5 per cent to \\r\\n8 per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China, growth slowed to its weakest pace since 2009. Meanwhile, in other \\r\\nemerging-market economies (EMEs), activity was weighed down by political \\r\\nuncertainty in several regions and tightening financial conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the factors contributing to slower growth in the first quarter appear to \\r\\nbe country-specific and their effects are likely to be transitory. The conditions \\r\\nsupporting a rebound in global activity remain in place, albeit starting from \\r\\na weaker level of activity than previously expected. The widespread nature \\r\\nof the slowdown, however, suggests that there could be less underlying \\r\\nmomentum in the global economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeadwinds to growth continue to abate, while financial \\r\\nconditions ease further\\r\\nMost of the factors restraining the pace of the global economic expansion \\r\\nin recent years have dissipated further, although some continue to have \\r\\nan impact. Fiscal drag is diminishing significantly in many advanced econ-\\r\\nomies (Chart 1). Household deleveraging in the United States and some \\r\\nother countries is well advanced, which should support domestic demand \\r\\n(Chart 2). At the same time, uncertainty appears to be undermining business \\r\\nconfidence and restraining investment.

In June, in response to declining inflation, weak \\r\\ngrowth and ongoing financial fragmentation, the European Central Bank \\r\\n(ECB) announced further stimulus measures, lowering its main interest \\r\\nrate to 0.15 per cent and introducing a negative deposit rate. The ECB also \\r\\nstated that it will implement targeted credit measures. Meanwhile, central \\r\\nbank balance sheets continue to expand in some countries (Chart 3). In the \\r\\nUnited States, although the Federal Reserve continues to reduce the size of \\r\\nits asset purchases, its balance sheet is still expanding, providing additional \\r\\nmonetary stimulus (Box 1). Moreover, the Federal Open Market Committee \\r\\n(FOMC) has reiterated its expectations that economic conditions may war-\\r\\nrant monetary policy remaining accommodative “even after employment and \\r\\ninflation are near mandate-consistent levels.”1\\r\\n\\r\\n1  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Press Release, 18 June 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n            \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n            \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0cUS$ trillions\\r\\nUS$ trillions\\r\\n5.0\\r\\n5.0\\r\\n\\r\\n2.5\\r\\n2.5\\r\\n\\r\\n0.0\\r\\n0.0\\r\\n\\r\\n-2.5\\r\\n-2.5\\r\\n\\r\\n-5.0\\r\\n-5.0\\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal EConoMy \\r\\nBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nBox 1\\r\\nBox 1\\r\\n\\r\\nFile information \\r\\nFile information \\r\\n(for internal use only): \\r\\n(for internal use only): \\r\\nChart 1-A.indd \\r\\nChart 1-A.indd \\r\\nLast output: 03:07:33 PM; Jul 15, 2014\\r\\nLast output: 03:07:33 PM; Jul 15, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Reserve Balance Sheet and Options for Its Exit Strategy\\r\\nThe Federal Reserve Balance Sheet and Options for Its Exit Strategy\\r\\nSince the autumn of 2008, the U .S .

The rebound is not anticipated \\r\\nto make up for the weakness in the first quarter, however, leaving the level \\r\\nof GDP on a lower path than assumed in the April Report. Over time, the \\r\\nexpansion in the advanced economies is anticipated to return their econ-\\r\\nomies to potential and enable them to achieve natural growth that is no \\r\\nlonger reliant on exceptional monetary policy stimulus.\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic demand in the United States is expected to pick up, underpinned \\r\\nby an expansion of credit, rising financial and housing wealth, and improving \\r\\nlabour market conditions. Specifically, consumption will be supported by \\r\\ngrowing household net worth and a gradual increase in disposable income. \\r\\nResidential investment is also expected to benefit from these factors, \\r\\ntogether with a rise in household formation and a gradual easing in credit \\r\\nstandards as the competition for new mortgage lending intensifies. Recent \\r\\nlabour market indicators have been encouraging, with roughly 230,000\\xa0net \\r\\nnew jobs created, on average, over the past six months; job openings \\r\\nrising to their highest level since August 2007; and the unemployment rate \\r\\ndeclining to 6.1 per cent. Despite these improvements, other labour market \\r\\nindicators, such as modest wage growth and elevated long-term unemploy-\\r\\nment, suggest that there is still considerable slack in the labour market, \\r\\nwhich is projected to keep inflationary pressures contained (Chart 6).\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness investment is expected to strengthen as uncertainty about future \\r\\ndemand diminishes, the cost of capital remains low and firms seek to put \\r\\ntheir ample cash holdings to work. That being said, momentum appears \\r\\nto be weaker than anticipated in April.

The rise in agricultural \\r\\nprices has been driven by a surge in cattle prices, owing to extremely tight \\r\\nsupplies, since U.S. cattle stocks have fallen to the lowest level in more \\r\\nthan five decades. Lumber prices have recovered some of their previous \\r\\ndecline as U.S. housing construction bounced back from the effects of the \\r\\nsevere winter, even though some previously unused production capacity \\r\\nhas been coming on stream. Meanwhile, the rise in base metals prices has \\r\\nbeen widespread and may be a sign of improving growth prospects. However, \\r\\nsupply-related issues, particularly the Indonesian ban on exports of metal \\r\\nores, have also pushed up prices.

Core inflation has also increased, but remains below 2 per cent. \\r\\nAlthough the Bank had anticipated in the April Report that higher con-\\r\\nsumer energy prices and exchange rate pass-through would exert tem-\\r\\nporary upward pressure on inflation, the increase occurred sooner and has \\r\\nbeen larger than anticipated. The higher-than-expected inflation readings \\r\\nprimarily reflect larger increases in energy prices, which are notoriously \\r\\nvolatile, as well as other sector-specific factors that have temporarily \\r\\naffected core inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank’s judgment is that underlying inflationary pressures remain muted, \\r\\ngiven the persistent slack in the economy and continued intense competi-\\r\\ntion in the retail sector. In light of the weaker global outlook, the Bank \\r\\nnow estimates that it will take a little longer than expected in April for the \\r\\nCanadian economy to return to full capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflation is expected to fluctuate close to 2 per cent over the next two \\r\\nyears as the temporary boost to inflation from the relative price shocks \\r\\nnoted above eases and the downward pressure on inflation arising from \\r\\nexcess supply and heightened retail competition gradually dissipates. As \\r\\nthe economy reaches its full capacity around mid-2016, both core and \\r\\ntotal CPI inflation are projected to converge on 2 per cent on a sustained \\r\\nbasis. Beyond the near term, the inflation projection is little changed from \\r\\nthe April Report.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian real GDP growth is projected to average around 2 1/4 per cent \\r\\nduring 2014–16. The abrupt slowing in global economic growth in the first \\r\\nquarter has once again delayed the expected pickup in exports and busi-\\r\\nness investment. However, the Bank continues to expect that the lower \\r\\nCanadian dollar and the projected strengthening of the global economy \\r\\nwill lead to a broadening of the composition of growth in Canada. \\r\\nMeanwhile, the Bank still anticipates a soft landing in the housing market \\r\\nand a continued constructive evolution of household imbalances.

While monthly inflation has picked up markedly in the past \\r\\nsix\\xa0months, this is mainly the result of larger price increases in categories \\r\\nthat are not believed to be affected by the degree of slack or competition \\r\\nin the Canadian economy.4 For example, tight supply conditions in North \\r\\nAmerica have caused meat prices to soar.5 In addition, there has been a \\r\\nrapid rise in electricity rates (included in the core measure). While there \\r\\nis obviously some uncertainty and there may be some upside risk to the \\r\\nnear-term path, the Bank does not expect the recent momentum in monthly \\r\\ninflation to persist. This is in part because the price increases in the sectors \\r\\nresponsible for the pickup are currently above their historical averages and \\r\\ntend to exhibit low inflation persistence, suggesting that they will subside \\r\\nquickly going forward. This is illustrated in Chart 12.6 The rise in total CPI \\r\\ninflation over the same period has been more pronounced than that of core \\r\\ninflation, owing to large increases in the prices for gasoline and natural gas.\\r\\n\\r\\n3  Respondents to the Bank’s summer Business Outlook Survey reported that strong competition con-\\r\\n\\r\\ntinues to restrain expectations for output prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n4  Over the past six months, monthly core CPI has risen at an average annual rate of 2.5 per cent.

The excluded components are fruit, vege-\\r\\ntables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation and tobacco products.\\r\\n\\r\\n6  The six-month inflation rate is the annualized percentage change in the price level between November \\r\\n2013 and May 2014. Individual components of the core CPI were seasonally adjusted using the Census \\r\\nBureau’s X-12-ARIMA procedure, and each six-month inflation rate is expressed as a deviation from its \\r\\naverage. Persistence is calculated as the sum of the first four autoregressive coefficients of quarter-\\r\\nover-quarter seasonally adjusted inflation.

In addition to higher \\r\\ncore inflation, the positive shock to total CPI inflation reflects higher-than-\\r\\nexpected gasoline prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depreciation of the Canadian dollar since the beginning of 2013 has put \\r\\nsome temporary upward pressure on inflation as higher import prices have \\r\\nbeen “passed through” to domestic consumer prices. Both the magnitude \\r\\nand the timing of the direct impact of the exchange rate on core inflation are \\r\\ndifficult to measure with precision. The impact varies across businesses, \\r\\ndepending on a number of factors, including import concentration and the \\r\\nduration of currency hedges. The Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey \\r\\nsuggests that some firms have already seen the effects of the exchange rate \\r\\ndepreciation filter through to the cost of their inputs, while others expect to \\r\\nsee these effects over coming quarters. The pass-through can be inferred \\r\\nby examining the evolution of inflation for goods with high import content. \\r\\nOver the past six months, core goods with higher import content—particu-\\r\\nlarly clothing and footwear—have registered larger price increases than \\r\\nthose with lower import content.\\r\\n\\r\\nPast exchange rate declines appear to be adding about 0.1 to 0.2 per-\\r\\ncentage points to core inflation at this time.7 Since some of the key volatile \\r\\ncomponents excluded from the core measure are more sensitive to \\r\\nexchange rate movements, the pass-through to total CPI inflation is esti-\\r\\nmated to be larger, at about 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points. In its base-case \\r\\nprojection, the Bank assumes that the direct impact on the level of prices of \\r\\nthe lower dollar will be complete by around the end of 2014. As a result, the \\r\\nimpact on year-over-year inflation should dissipate by the end of next year.\\r\\n\\r\\n7  The depreciation of the Canadian dollar also has an indirect impact through higher demand, since it \\r\\n\\r\\nreduces the prices of goods and services produced in Canada relative to those produced elsewhere, \\r\\nstimulating foreign demand for Canadian exports and shifting domestic demand toward domestically \\r\\nproduced goods and services.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n     \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n            \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0c14  Canadian EConoMy \\r\\n\\r\\nBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian economy continues to operate below full \\r\\ncapacity\\r\\nAs reflected in the Bank’s base-case scenario, for inflation to be sustained \\r\\nat 2\\xa0per cent, excess capacity in the economy will have to be absorbed. \\r\\nOtherwise, inflation would drift back down and stay below 2 per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank estimates that the degree of excess capacity in the economy \\r\\nremained largely unchanged during the first half of 2014 (Chart\\xa013).

The \\r\\nBank’s outlook for exports balances these initial positive signs against the \\r\\nlower path of global activity over the projection horizon. Overall, moderate \\r\\nexport growth is expected as foreign activity strengthens and the competi-\\r\\ntiveness of Canadian firms benefits from a lower Canadian dollar (Chart\\xa016).\\r\\n\\r\\nBank analysis has found that, in many non-energy subsectors (which \\r\\naccount for about half of the value of non-energy exports), exports have been \\r\\nbehaving broadly in line with, or better than, the indicators of foreign demand \\r\\nsince 2000.9 Therefore, as U.S. activity strengthens—and with support from \\r\\nthe lower exchange rate—these subsectors, including building and packaging \\r\\nmaterials, machinery and equipment, commercial services, and aircraft and \\r\\naircraft parts, are expected to benefit.

In \\r\\naddition, existing home prices have continued to rise at a faster pace than \\r\\ndisposable income. Compared with a year ago, the growth in house prices \\r\\nhas been particularly strong in Vancouver, Calgary and the Toronto region. \\r\\nWhile there are risks in both directions, the Bank continues to expect that \\r\\nthe level of residential investment will be relatively unchanged over the \\r\\nprojection horizon and that its share of the overall economy will decline to a \\r\\nmore  sustainable level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank expects moderate growth in consumer spending over the projec-\\r\\ntion horizon, broadly in line with the growth of household disposable income \\r\\nand supported by improvements in Canada’s terms of trade. Household \\r\\ncredit is expected to continue growing at a rate well below its historical \\r\\naverage, but at a pace similar to that of disposable income. Consequently, \\r\\nthe ratio of household debt to disposable income is expected to stabilize \\r\\nand the savings rate to remain within recent ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile current developments are consistent with an ongoing constructive \\r\\nevolution of household imbalances, vulnerabilities in the household sector \\r\\nthat stem from stretched valuations in the housing market and elevated \\r\\nindebtedness remain important. The Bank’s June Financial System Review \\r\\nprovides a more in-depth assessment of these and other vulnerabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0c18  Canadian EConoMy \\r\\n\\r\\nBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy must reach and remain at full capacity for \\r\\ninflation to be maintained sustainably at the 2 per cent target\\r\\nFor the inflation target to be achieved on a sustained basis, the economy \\r\\nwill first have to reach and then remain at full capacity.

Economic projections, \\r\\nsuch as the base case presented in this Report, provide guid-\\r\\nance on the future path of infl ation, based on the expected \\r\\nevolution of the macroeconomic drivers of infl ation—most \\r\\nimportantly, the extent of excess supply or demand in the \\r\\neconomy . Such macroeconomic projections are particularly \\r\\nimportant for understanding the likely path of infl ation, and \\r\\nthe risks around that path, beyond the next few quarters—i .e ., \\r\\nthe horizon at which monetary policy actions taken today will \\r\\nstart to have an eﬀ ect .\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, an important challenge faced by policy-makers is \\r\\nthat movements in both core and total CPI infl ation can be \\r\\ncaused by a variety of factors that are not directly related to \\r\\nmovements in underlying macroeconomic fundamentals .1 For \\r\\nexample, measured infl ation will be infl uenced by changes in \\r\\nregulated prices that are often unrelated to domestic demand \\r\\nconditions . thus, the level of infl ation today may refl ect \\r\\nfactors other than fundamentals and, as a result, may or may \\r\\nnot be a good indicator of where infl ation will be in the future . \\r\\nIn addition, estimates of fundamentals, such as the extent of \\r\\nexcess capacity in the economy, are subject to uncertainty, as \\r\\nare estimates of the impact of changes in these fundamentals \\r\\non infl ation . these sources of uncertainty are important risks \\r\\nto the infl ation outlook .\\r\\n\\r\\n1  the fl uctuations induced by these types of factors are somewhat less for core \\r\\n\\r\\ninfl ation than for total CPI infl ation, since the core measure excludes eight of the \\r\\nmost volatile components of the CPI .\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a risk-management approach to the conduct of monetary \\r\\npolicy, it is important not only to take account of the down-\\r\\nside and upside risks to the base-case projection for infl ation \\r\\nthat are associated with the evolution of the fundamental \\r\\ndeterminants of infl ation, but also to recognize that the \\r\\nweights attached to these upside and downside risks depend \\r\\non the “starting point” and the projected level of infl ation . \\r\\nFor example, if the fundamentals are weak and the starting \\r\\npoint is low relative to the target, downside risks to infl ation \\r\\nassociated with the fundamentals assume increasing import-\\r\\nance because they would push infl ation even further below \\r\\nthe target . Similarly, if the fundamentals are strong and the \\r\\nstarting point is high relative to the target, upside risks to \\r\\ninfl ation associated with the fundamentals assume increasing \\r\\nimportance because they would push infl ation even further \\r\\nabove the target . Moreover, in situations where infl ation is \\r\\npersistently away from the target, there is an additional risk \\r\\nthat infl ation expectations may become unanchored, making \\r\\nit even more diﬃ  cult for monetary policy to bring infl ation \\r\\nback to target .\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen infl ation is close to the target, risks related to the \\r\\nfore cast remain important . typically, these risks would be \\r\\nbalanced in a new projection, but there remains scope for \\r\\nasymmetry, such as when policy is constrained by the eﬀ ective \\r\\nlower bound or when the risks around the forecast are skewed .\\r\\n\\r\\na risk-management framework for monetary policy will incor-\\r\\nporate consideration of a broader set of risks than mentioned \\r\\nabove, including those related to ﬁ nancial stability .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path of core inflation will reflect the outcome of various factors at play. \\r\\nThe depreciation of the Canadian dollar over the past year and the effects \\r\\nof sector-specific shocks are expected to continue to put upward pressure \\r\\non year-over-year core inflation until about the end of next year. In contrast, \\r\\nexcess capacity in the economy and heightened competition in the retail \\r\\nsector are anticipated to continue to exert downward pressure on core infla-\\r\\ntion—although at a diminishing rate—over most of the projection horizon. As \\r\\nexcess capacity in the economy is absorbed and the effects of heightened \\r\\nretail competition wane, core inflation is expected to stabilize at 2 per cent \\r\\naround mid-2016 (Chart\\xa017). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the \\r\\nintense competitive pressures have led retailers to increase their investment \\r\\nin technologies to improve productivity and reduce costs, putting downward \\r\\npressure on retail prices. If adoption of these technology improvements \\r\\nbecomes more widespread, the disinflationary pressures could be larger or \\r\\npersist longer than currently assumed.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0c20  Canadian EConoMy \\r\\n\\r\\nBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\nLast output: 09:01:04 PM; Jul 14, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nFile information \\r\\n(for internal use only): \\r\\nCore infl ation -- CEA -- EN.indd\\r\\n\\r\\nChart 17:  Infl ation is expected to return sustainably to 2 per cent around mid-2016\\r\\n\\r\\nYear-over-year percentage change, quarterly data\\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n-1\\r\\n\\r\\n-2\\r\\n\\r\\n2007\\r\\n\\r\\n2008\\r\\n\\r\\n2009\\r\\n\\r\\n2010\\r\\n\\r\\n2011\\r\\n\\r\\n2012\\r\\n\\r\\n2013\\r\\n\\r\\n2014\\r\\n\\r\\n2015\\r\\n\\r\\n2016\\r\\n\\r\\n Total CPI\\r\\n\\r\\n Core CPIa\\r\\n\\r\\n Target\\r\\n\\r\\n Control range\\r\\n\\r\\na.

There is, as always, much uncer-\\r\\ntainty about the profile of the total CPI, since it incorporates movements in \\r\\nvolatile energy components. For example, if the base-case scenario were to \\r\\nassume that oil prices were 10 per cent higher (lower), total CPI inflation would \\r\\nbe higher (lower) by 0.3 percentage points over the coming year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndicators of short-term inflation expectations are consistent with the \\r\\nBank’s projection. The June Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI \\r\\ninflation was 1.8 per cent for 2014 and 2.0 per cent for 2015. According to \\r\\nthe latest Business Outlook Survey, over 90 per cent of the firms surveyed \\r\\nexpect inflation to be within the Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control \\r\\nrange, with the majority expecting it to be in the bottom half of the range. \\r\\nFirms cite retail competition and subdued economic growth as factors that \\r\\nare expected to keep inflation low. Market-based measures of longer-term \\r\\ninflation expectations also remain consistent with the 2 per cent target. With \\r\\ntotal CPI inflation now close to 2 per cent, the risk of a downward drift in \\r\\ninflation expectations has diminished.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range \\r\\naround the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3\\xa0percentage \\r\\npoints.11 This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty. \\r\\nFan charts, which are derived using statistical analysis of forecast errors \\r\\nfrom the Bank’s projection models, provide a complementary perspective. \\r\\nChart\\xa018 and Chart\\xa019 show the 50 per cent and 90 per cent confidence \\r\\nbands for year-over-year core inflation and total CPI inflation from the third \\r\\nquarter of 2014 to the end of 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n11  See Box 1 in the October 2013 Monetary Policy Report.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n   \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n            \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0cFile information \\r\\n(for internal use only): \\r\\nFile: FAN Core CPI infl ation -- CEA -- EN.indd \\r\\n\\r\\nLast output: 04:48:17 PM; Jul 14, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nFile information \\r\\n(for internal use only): \\r\\nFile: FAN Total CPI infl ation -- CEA -- EN.indd\\r\\n\\r\\nLast output: 04:54:45 PM; Jul 14, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian EConoMy  21 \\r\\n\\r\\nChart 18:  Projection for core infl ation\\r\\n\\r\\nChart 19:  Projection for total CPI infl ation\\r\\n\\r\\nYear-over-year percentage change, quarterly data\\r\\n\\r\\nYear-over-year percentage change, quarterly data\\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n%\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n2011\\r\\n\\r\\n2012\\r\\n\\r\\n2013\\r\\n\\r\\n2014\\r\\n\\r\\n2015\\r\\n\\r\\n2016\\r\\n\\r\\n Projection\\r\\n\\r\\n 50 per cent confi dence interval\\r\\n 90 per cent confi dence interval\\r\\n\\r\\n2011\\r\\n\\r\\n2012\\r\\n\\r\\n2013\\r\\n\\r\\n2014\\r\\n\\r\\n2015\\r\\n\\r\\n2016\\r\\n\\r\\n Projection\\r\\n\\r\\n 50 per cent confi dence interval\\r\\n 90 per cent confi dence interval\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: Bank of Canada\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: Bank of Canada\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0cBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nRisks to thE inflation outlook  23 \\r\\n\\r\\nRisks to the inflation outlook\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outlook for inflation is subject to several risks emanating from both the \\r\\nexternal environment and the domestic economy. The Bank judges that the \\r\\nrisks to the projected inflation path are roughly balanced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important risks to inflation are the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n(i)  The global outlook\\r\\n\\r\\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to a considerable \\r\\ndegree of uncertainty. The widespread weakness in the first quarter \\r\\nprovided yet another example of disappointment regarding global \\r\\ngrowth outcomes. Thus, a period of protracted global economic \\r\\nweakness associated with pervasive uncertainty, chronically defi-\\r\\ncient demand and weaker potential GDP growth remains possible. \\r\\nAlternatively, as the global economy rebounds, confidence could \\r\\nimprove more rapidly, particularly in the United States, boosting \\r\\ninvestment and employment and spurring trade, leading to a virtuous \\r\\ncircle of self-sustaining growth. These downside and upside risks \\r\\nto the global economy would be played out in parallel in Canada \\r\\nthrough impacts on commodity prices, Canadian exports, Canada’s \\r\\nterms of trade and confidence effects on private domestic demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n(ii)  Continued underperformance of Canadian exports\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a wide range of export sectors are expected to benefit from the \\r\\ncontinued strengthening of the U.S. economy, a sustained rebound \\r\\nin non-energy exports has proven elusive. The precise timing of the \\r\\nrealignment in growth is highly uncertain and could take longer than \\r\\nanticipated by the Bank. The risk of such a delay would be exacer-\\r\\nbated if there were further losses of export competitiveness. A slower \\r\\nrecovery in non-energy exports would also translate into slower \\r\\ngrowth in business investment, particularly investment in machinery \\r\\nand equipment. Together, weaker exports and business investment \\r\\npose a downside risk to inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(iii)  Weaker growth in emerging-market economies\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in EMEs could disappoint. In China, recent indicators point \\r\\nto a sharp slowdown in the housing sector. Beyond the direct effects \\r\\nof lower housing activity, this could also result in a greater-than-\\r\\nanticipated slowdown in credit growth and an extended period of \\r\\ndeleveraging that would weigh on growth. There is also a risk that the \\r\\nweakness in other EMEs will persist longer than currently expected. In \\r\\nparticular, political uncertainty could continue, undermining business \\r\\nconfidence and delaying progress on economic reforms. These shocks \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0c24  Risks to thE inflation outlook \\r\\n\\r\\nBank OF Canada  •  MOnEtaRy POlICy REPORt  •  JUly 2014\\r\\n\\r\\ncould have negative spillover effects on the global economy and would \\r\\nbe transmitted to the Canadian economy through weaker exports, \\r\\nlower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n(iv)  Higher commodity prices\\r\\n\\r\\nGeopolitical events, such as the conflict in Iraq or a renewal of ten-\\r\\nsions in Libya, could lead to a significant supply disruption in oil \\r\\nmarkets. An intensification of these conflicts, or other events that \\r\\ncould disrupt production, would put upward pressure on prices. If \\r\\nthese events occurred, Canada’s terms of trade would improve, pro-\\r\\nviding modest support to wealth and consumer spending in Canada. \\r\\nThis mildly favourable effect would be partly offset, however, by any \\r\\nadverse effects on global economic growth from an oil price shock.\\r\\n\\r\\n(v) \\r\\n\\r\\nImbalances in the household sector\\r\\nWhile a soft landing in the housing market remains the most likely \\r\\nscenario, near record-high house prices and debt levels relative to \\r\\nincome leave households vulnerable to adverse shocks. The recent \\r\\nrebound in housing activity is most likely only compensating for \\r\\nweakness in earlier months, but it could signal the beginning of a \\r\\nmore persistent rise in housing activity and price pressures. Renewed \\r\\nmomentum in residential investment would provide a temporary \\r\\nboost to economic activity, although it could also further exacerbate \\r\\nexisting imbalances in the household sector and increase the likeli-\\r\\nhood and potential severity of a correction later on. A disorderly \\r\\nunwinding of household sector imbalances, should it materialize, \\r\\ncould have sizable negative effects on other parts of the economy \\r\\nand on inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\x0c'"

[That  was  the change  in  System holdings ofsecurities]  since when?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  That  was  for  all  of  \\'79.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Steve,  if you want  to  add  something  thatbears upon  the  nature  of  the  operations,  this  is  probably as  good atime as  any to  do  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, we  have  some  tables we  could passout,  which are  somewhat  similar  to  the  ones  that  we made  available  tothe  Committee  at  the  last meeting and which might  be helpful  inconsidering how and whether  to proceed with these techniques.  Thesetables  are designed  to  elaborate  the numbers  that underlie Mr.Sternlight\\'s  operations.  As  you  can see,  they  are  divided  into  twocolumns.  On  the  thought  that  the  Committee wouldn\\'t want  to  get  toofar  off  its  path  for any  sustained period,  we divided  this  period--theseven-week  intermeeting period--into  a four-week interval  and a three-week  interval.  The  three-week period ends  tomorrow.  The  tables[exhibit]  all  the perils  of  lagged reserve accounting,  which makes  therelation between  reserves  and money in  the  short  run not  as  close asone might hope.  [Operations]  were  designed to  attempt to  attain agrowth rate  in M1  in  the  September-to-December period  of  a little over4 percent  and  in  the November-to-December period of  something  like  5percent.  In  the  event,  as you  saw in  the  Bluebook, we were  a bitshort  on  the  growth rate  in M1  and also  in M2;  but  I think within anyreasonable margin of  error we  were not  really very far  short.If you  focus  on  the  last  column, which  [covers]  the mostrecent  three-week period, you  can see  that  the monetary base turnedout  about  $379  million  short  of  the  original path we  set.  And you cansee  that  total  reserves turned  out  about  $218 million  short  of  theadjusted path.  As  will be  clear shortly,  the  adjustments were  only  $4million.  So  it  really  is  about  $220  million short  of  the  originalpath;  there was  a currency shortfall  involved.  With  total  reservesrunning short,  the  Manager  added roughly  $150  million to  the  originalnonborrowed path.  That  is  shown in  the  third panel,  where you seeadjustments  of  $146  million.  That  simply  is  the  $150  million addedminus  the  $4 million, which was  a decline  in the  original  totalreserve  path.  So  that  is  the  added adjustment  to  nonborrowed reservesbecause  total  reserves were running short  of what  seemed consistentwith  this money stock  figure,  again recognizing the  looseness  inlinkages because  of  lagged  reserve accounting.  Thus,  to  translatethat  into borrowings, you can  see  that  the original  path based on  theCommittee\\'s  decision in  November, which was  to  assume borrowings  at$1.7  billion, would be  subtracted  from total  reserves  to  give  [thelevel  of  nonborrowed reserves]  the Manager would  aim  for  initially.After  the  $150 million adjustment,  that would  get us  down to  $1,550million in borrowings;  and given the  weakness  in total  reservesdemanded relative  to  what was  projected as  needed to  get  the  [desiredgrowth  in  the]  aggregates,  actual borrowings,  of  course,  fell  short\\x0c1/8-9/80even  of  that.  So  the  deviation of  $218  million  from the  [assumedlevel  of]  borrowing  turned out  to be  exactly  the  same  as  the  deviationfrom the  adjusted total  reserve path  of  $218  million.  That\\'s  justsimply arithmetic.The  source  of  some  of  the problems we  were  having  is  shown onthe next  page;  they  are  inherent  in  this  kind  of  targeting procedure.Again,  I\\'d  say  that  thus  far  I think we\\'ve been fairly  lucky in  comingup with  growth in money  that was pretty  consistent with what  theCommittee wanted.  As  you can  see,  on  the  original  total  reserve pathwe were off  $222 million from  [the path]  we  first  constructed.Adjustments  came  later.  They really involved  two  components,  and theywent  in opposite  directions.  One was  excess reserves,  which actuallyturned out  to  be  $166  million higher than we had built  into  theoriginal path;  that  is  line  B in  the  last  column.  And in  terms  of  theuses  of  total  reserves,  required reserves were  running  $388  millionweaker.  So,  simply taking  total  reserves  as  the  sum of  excess andrequired reserves,  total  reserves were  running  [below by]  $222million.  Thinking of  it  from  the  sources side,  we  just  didn\\'t  supplythat much reserves.  With  lagged reserve  accounting, to  do  so we wouldhave had to pile  in  a lot  more excess  reserves  than  even  the bankswere willing to  hold.  I don\\'t  know how much that would have  amountedto  because we would have  had to  run down borrowings  to begin with.Now, the  bulk  of  the  shortfall  in  required reserves was inthe  type  of  liabilities  requiring reserves  that  didn\\'t  enter  intoeither M1  or  M2.  As you can  see,  there were  shortfalls relative  toexpectations  of  $80  million  in  large  CDs,  $90  million  in U.S.government deposits,  and  $167  million  in  the marginal  reserves,  whichare  connected with  the  shortfall  in  large  CDs.  That\\'s  essentiallybecause  bank credit ran a lot weaker than we  expected and banks  simplywere not borrowing  in the  market  in  order to  meet those  creditdemands.  Thus,  we  adjusted the path, really,  so  that  the Managerwouldn\\'t  supply those  reserves.  We  hadn\\'t made  any adjustments  topath  since October  6th until  this past  three weeks.  And we had suchlarge consistent  shortfalls  in  these  items  that  it  seemed that wewould get  too much money unless we  adjusted the path, so  the Managerin effect absorbed the  reserves  released by  the  decline  in  thesedeposits.  Of  course there was a shortfall  in  currency relative toexpectations,  as  shown  in  the  third  line,  line E.  And  in  terms  ofreserve  requirements,  that meant we would have had to  add  $30  millionto  total  reserves  to  compensate  for  the  shortfall  in  currency.However,  that was more  than made up,  as  you can see,  by  the  sharp dropin required reserves behind  large negotiable CDs,  U.S.  governmentdeposits,  and marginal  reserves.  Those minuses  much more  thancompensated for  the  added reserves needed for  the  shortfall  incurrency.  That  is,  simply put,  the drop  in negotiable CDs  releasedreserves  that  could be  used  to expand  the  deposits  needed to  make upfor  the  shortfall  in  currency.  So,  netting  through all  those  things,we ended up  reducing the  total  reserve  path by $175  million, as  youcan  see  in  line  F, to  reflect  changes  in deposit mix and  in currencyflows.  It\\'s  a rather rough net  that won\\'t add up  exactly, but  it  goesin the  direction that  all  items  listed under  D and E would suggest  on[balance].  On  the  other  hand, because  excess  reserves were runningextremely  [high],  we  felt we  had  to  add reserves because banks\\'behavior with regard to  excess  reserves was  totally different  in  termsof magnitude  from what  we had expected.  So  in  the  end,  as  Petermentioned, because  banks  kept  holding more  excess  reserves  than we\\x0c1/8-9/80were  expecting  every week,  somewhat belatedly we added  $171  million.So,  those  adjustments net  out to  virtually nothing.  If  you  took  thatminus  $4 million  and related  it  to  the  $222  million, you get  this  $218million, which  is  the  deviation  from  the adjusted  path.  In general,this  time  it  seemed very reasonable  to  make these  adjustments  to  thepath.  In  the  previous  periods we did  not because  we didn\\'t  seeextremely  large  sustained movements;  the movements  we did  see  in  theearlier periods were more  toward rapid expansion in  CDs  and in bankcredit,  things  that  we assumed  the  Committee wanted  to  hold down.However, this  time  it was  toward very weak bank credit;  and we  assumedthat  the Committee  did not want  that  very weak bank credit  to  bereflected  in excessive  expansion  in Ml,  so  we made  some  offsettingadjustments.  Of  course,  with lagged  reserve accounting,  the  impactson Ml  are not  related one-for-one  to  what we  do  this  week.  One  has  towait for  some  time  to come.  But  in  any  event,  by the  time  all  thiswas  done,  we  still  ended up  with weak  total  reserves  because  wecouldn\\'t provide  enough nonborrowed  reserves  to bring  total  reservesup  to  path within  this  three-week period.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I\\'m  sure  that\\'s  crystal  clear!  So,  Ithink  it\\'s  time  to  raise  questions--not  just  on the  details  of  Peter\\'soperations,  but  questions  that bear upon  the  operating techniquesgenerally.  Governor Partee.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Well,  just  a comment.  I think  I understood thedirection of your adjustments,  Steve,  as you went  through  this.  But  Icertainly  don\\'t  understand  it  from  this  table  on the  second page.  Ican\\'t make  out  the magnitude of  the  adjustments.  The  arithmetic justdoesn\\'t  work very well,  at  least  as  I was  trying  to  follow what yousaid, although  I understand  the  direction of  change.  The  otherquestion I have  is  on  the very last  comment you made, which was  thateven after  these  adjustments you  fell  short  of  the desired  adjustedreserve path because you  just  couldn\\'t  supply  the nonborrowedreserves.  Would you  explain why it  is  that you  couldn\\'t get  in  thenonborrowed  reserves?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  He  couldn\\'t  get  in  the  total  reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  We  fell  short  on  total  reserves, not  on  thenonborrowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Well,  one  of  the  things  that  is  disturbing me--about  the whole period really  but  particularly the  last  month or  so--is  that  we don\\'t  seem to  be getting  any market  impact.  We have  tohave  feed-through  if  this process  is  going  to  work.  And yet,regardless  of  the  shortfall  in  reserves  and  the  shortfall  in money andthe fact  that  borrowings were  coming down, we  held  the  funds  rate  atabout  14  percent  all  the way  through.  It  looks  as  if  somebody  else  isdetermining the  funds  rate.  My question  is:  Under thosecircumstances,  since we weren\\'t  anywhere  close  to  the  bottom level  ofthe  funds  rate range  that  was  specified, why didn\\'t you put  in morenonborrowed reserves  in  order  to  try  to get  this  process  of  adjustmentin  the market  going more  strongly  than  it  did?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  Governor  Partee,  that\\'s  certainly a veryfair question.  It  has  always  been an  issue,  so  far  as  I understandthe procedures.  My understanding  of  the  original  Committee  decisionwas  that  we would put  more weight  on  nonborrowed reserves  than  on\\x0c1/8-9/80total  reserves, but  still  the Manager would have  freedom when therewas  clear  cause.  The  staff would have  the  freedom to  adjust the  totalreserves  but  the Manager would have  the  freedom to  adjust  thenonborrowed  reserves when  there was  clear  cause  for  there being ashortfall.  So,  early in the  three-week period, we  did add  $150million  to  nonborrowed when  it  appeared  that  the gap between the  totalreserves  path and  total  reserves demanded was  something  on  the  orderof  $450  million.  And then in  each successive  week that  gap  of  $450million  kept getting narrower  as  required reserves  began revising  upfrom what  we  had  [projected].  The money supply  [growth]  estimate  forpercent  or  so,  I think;  it has  now ended up at  5-1/2  percent.  So  asthat gap narrowed, I think--Peter can speak  for himself--we were  alittle  reluctant  to make any further adjustment because we were  goingin  the right  direction and we  were on  the  nonborrowed path.  Now, itdid  seem  to us  that  the  funds  rate  ought  to  drop  as member bankborrowing  dropped  from $1.7  billion  to  the  $1.2  to  $1.3  billion area.In  the event,  now  that bank borrowings  in  the last  past  three dayshave been running  $600  or  $700  million and the  funds  rate  still  hasnot dropped,  there  seems  to  have been a change  in  the  demand forborrowing  function,  so  to  speak.  That  is,  member banks,  who had beenvery willing borrowers  in  late  October and over  the  course  ofis  now--have backed away  from the  window.  It\\'s quite  possible that wehave  been late  in  catching up with  that and  that  in  some  sense  thenonborrowed path ought  to have been  set  higher because  of  this  changein member banks\\'  borrowing patterns.  And as  Mr.  Sternlight mentionedin his  briefing, this week in  effect he\\'s  adding more  to  thenonborrowed path  than is  indicated  even  in  this  table becauseborrowing  is  running so  low.  If  that\\'s  the  case,  then  the  $1.7billion  of  borrowing that  was  set  originally was way  too high  toachieve  those particular targets,  and  the  downward adjustments  in  themare  coming, in  a sense,  with a lag.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  There  may be a fair  [amount  of]  instability  inthat demand.  You may remember  a month ago,  or  seven weeks  ago  orwhenever  [the meeting]  was,  we  thought  there had been an  increase  inthe  demand  for borrowings  compared with earlier  in  the  experience whenthere wasn\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What plausible  reason do you have  for  thefunds rate  staying as  high as  it  has with borrowings as  low as  theyare?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  I don\\'t have  any very good reason at  $600  or$700 million, but  at  $1.2  and  $1.3  billion I think  that\\'s  returningmore  to  the historical pattern.  When we  evaluate the  spread of  thefunds  rate  over  the discount  rate,  $1.2  or  $1.3  billion of borrowingisn\\'t unreasonable.  What  was  out  of  the  historical pattern wasspread that was  even less  than we have now.  That  was what was  [off]the  historical pattern.  What  we  had up  until  three days  ago  is  closerto  the  historical pattern.  Now we have much  less  borrowing than  onewould expect historically,  and I would assume borrowing  is  going  tojump back up.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  If  I can  interject,  these  last  few days  seemdifficult  to  explain;  the rather  low  level  of  borrowing  is  just not\\x0c1/8-9/80-5-what one would associate with  a  funds  rate  of  around  2 percent  overthe discount  rate.  And, as  Steve mentioned,  because  of  that we madean interim  adjustment  in what  we were aiming  for  in  nonborrowedreserves,  feeling  that  to  try  to  press nonborrowed reserves  down  tothe  path  level  in  this  current  week would have meant  going  into  theor  14  percent.  That  obviously didn\\'t make  sense;  and in  effect we\\'vebeen running  this  week with  an  assumption  that  an  adjustment  of  about$500  to  $600  million  should be  added to  the  nonborrowed or  taken awayfrom the  [borrowed]  reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  I know  it\\'s  awfully early, but what bothers meabout  this whole  experiment  so  far,  Paul,  is  that  I don\\'t  get anysense of  dynamics working.  That  is,  we had a very nice  outcome  takingthe  quarter  as  a whole.  I think everybody around  the  table wouldagree  that  the  money number  calmed down  and the  markets  have beenbetter  and all  that.  But  that  all could  have been an adjustment  tothe  one-time  change  in  conditions  that  occurred  early in  October,  withmuch higher rates  and  the availability  constraint  and  that  kind ofthing.  Since  then  I haven\\'t  had much sense  of  dynamics  in  the  processthat would  lead to,  say, restoration of  a  higher growth  rate  in moneyif  it  were  lower  than  what we wanted.  And  it  has  tended  to  be  lowerthan  we wanted.  Perhaps  it\\'s  just  too  early, but  I don\\'t  see  it.That\\'s  what bothers me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We would have  seen what you are talkingabout  if  the  funds  rate had seemed to  reflect  this  low level  ofborrowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  I  think  that\\'s probably right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Coldwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Steve,  for my  simple-minded, poor mathematicalabilities,  tell  me  if  I can make  this  statement  and  say  it\\'sreasonably accurate:  That  the  things  that  threw you off  were  thedemand for  excess  reserves  and the  shortfall  in borrowing.  The  latterwas  being made up by  an  enlarged nonborrowed path and  the  former--coupled with a  currency shortfall,  I guess--brought you to  theshortfall  in  the  total  required reserves  path.  Is  that  reasonablyclose  or not?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  [Yes],  in  looking at  the  uses  of  totalreserves.  But  if  you  really make  it  tough  for yourself  and analyzethis  by looking  at  the  sources  of  total  reserves, as  I  think  oneshould--if you  think  you\\'re  on a  total  reserve target,  which  theCommittee has  not  clearly  said  it\\'s  on,  having said  it\\'s  much more ona nonborrowed target--you would say  that  we  fell  short  on  the  totalreserves  in  this  three-week period  simply because  we didn\\'t  put  inenough nonborrowed reserves  to push up  the  total  reserves  to  target.Of  course,  if  we had put  in nonborrowed reserves--given  the  requiredreserves,  which aren\\'t  going  to  change  that  fast--borrowings wouldhave dropped,  one  for  one.  Then  eventually we would have had  to  addto  the  excess  reserves, which were  running  [about]  $400  or  $500million, and we would have  ended up with  $700  million  or  so  in excessreserves--that would have  been the mechanism--and very close  to  zeroborrowing  to  attain  this.  The  funds  rate  very likely would havedropped well  below the bottom  of  the range.  I would  say--and  I don\\'t\\x0c1/8-9/80know if Mr. Sternlight would put  it  in  the  same way--that  if  youthought we were  on a total  reserve  target,  the  reason we  fell  shortwas  that we  didn\\'t  push out  the  nonborrowed reserves  aggressivelyenough  and push up  excess  reserves--which  is  all we  can  push aroundwith required reserves  fixed--sufficiently  to  get  the  total  reserves.And what  would have stopped us would have been the  bottom  of  the  fundsrate  range.  We\\'d clearly have  gone below that.What  in practice  stopped us,  I think, was  that  the pattern  wesaw developing was  not  out  of  keeping with what  in  effect had beenplanned  at  the  time  of  the  Committee meeting and, judging  from  theCommittee\\'s discussion, what  the  Committee would have  foundacceptable.  That  is,  at  the  time  of  the  Committee meeting we  had ajust  after the  meeting when we had the revisions--Ml  growth of  7.9percent.  Midway through the  period we were  looking  at  growth  inmid-December.  Then  [our  estimates  changed]  as  we got  to  the  end ofpercent and  in December  of  5.7  percent.  So  it  began  to  look  to usthat  growth was moving up.  That\\'s what  I was explaining  to GovernorPartee.  Required reserves  were coming up and  as  the  period went  on--in  the  last  two  or  three weeks--our shortfall  against  total  reserveswas becoming less;  it  appeared  that  we were moving  in  the properdirection.  And since  we were right  on  the  nonborrowed adjusted path,which was already  $150  million above what was originally set,  itdidn\\'t  seem reasonable  in  that  context  to  take  a more  aggressiveaction  to chase  the  total  reserves  in  this  very short period.  I don\\'tknow whether  I\\'m being extremely clear, but  I think  that\\'s  the  trueanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  We\\'re back  in  1937.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

WALLICH.  The mechanism described just  now must have  somesimilarity with what went on  during  the  \\'30s when  [the  FOMC]  foundthat  it  could not  generate  the money  supply it wanted.  Well,  I don\\'t\\x0c1/8-9/80know what  [the  FOMC  at  the  time]  wanted, but  at  any  rate most  of  theexpansion they did  engage  in, mostly through  gold purchases notsecurity purchases,  went into  excess  reserves.  But  this  is  a veryfaint  effect here, which would not worry me  a great  deal.  What  doesworry me  is  that  I now encounter,  not  only here but  abroad, acriticism of  our procedures  that  in effect  says  we\\'re  back  to  theprocedures  of  the 1920s  when borrowing was  regarded  as  contractionary;the  more borrowed reserves you had, the  more contractionary effect  youwere  setting up.  Banks were  trying  to  get  out  of  debt,  so  to push  thebanks  into  debt was  the way to  tighten  credit;  that  is  sometimesassociated with Riefler\\'s  name.  As  I say,  I have  heard  this  commentthat  our procedures  now are very  similar  to  that.  We push the banksinto  rediscount, by operating  on nonborrowed reserves;  the  lessnonborrowed  reserves we  supply, the more  they have  to  borrow;  andthat,  we  say, lowers  monetary  expansion.  It  does  so  presumably bydriving up  the  funds  rate  and driving up  other  rates,  and  that  reducesthe  demand for money.  Now, I wouldn\\'t  say that  this  is  a  badmechanism.  And I wouldn\\'t  say  that borrowing  is  expansionary  as  someof  our  critics  say  in  the  sense  that more  reserves,  of  course,  is  moreexpansionary than  less  reserves.  I would  say  that we  aim  at  a givenvolume of  reserves  and  that  the  composition of  that volume  of  reservesmakes  a difference.  If  they\\'re all nonborrowed,  it\\'s moreexpansionary  than if  a higher  percentage of  them is  borrowed.  Thatseems  to me  a reasonable approach.In  support  of a rejection  of  this  criticism I would arguethat  some  of  the  things we  experienced here  all  do  point  in  somewhatthe  same  direction.  We got  low borrowing at  a given  interest  rate.That would suggest  that  there  is  greater  reluctance to be  in  debt  nowthan  there was  in  the  past  and  that  there  is  a true  reluctance  to  bein debt  that  causes  banks  to  restrain  their  [credit]  expansion.Second, we get  high excess  reserves.  Well,  that  seems  to  be  the  samephenomenon  of  caution on  the part  of  the banks.  They don\\'t want  toget  into  debt;  they\\'d  rather  have  excess  reserves.  And,  finally,  thefunds  rate  remains high and  doesn\\'t  go  down as  one would expect.Well,  again,  they\\'re bidding  for  funds  in  order  to  have  liquidity,  inorder  to  be  safe.  I could visualize  that  this  is  simply happeningbecause we\\'re  in  a  transition period and  they are  learning  the ropes.And  after a while  the willingness  [to  hold]  excess  reserves  will  wearoff  and  the  reluctance  to borrow may wear  off.  But  for  the  timebeing, it  seems  to me  that  this  criticism  that  I hear--and  as  I say  Iwas  surprised  to hear  it  in  Switzerland--is  not  justified.  I\\'d liketo  hear what  Peter and Steve  have  to say  about  this.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  I think you  sorted  out  those  pointsvery well,  Governor Wallich.  Borrowing has  always  had this  kind  ofdual role.  It\\'s  a  source  of  reserves,  but  it\\'s  a  source  of  reserveswith a  string  on  it  and  is  certainly less  expansionary than if  thosereserves  came  from open market purchases  or  even  from  float  or  someother  factor  beyond our  control.  We\\'ve  found ourselves  having  to  makeadjustments  for  the possible  change  in  attitudes  of banks  toward  thewindow.  I alluded  to one  just now.  We  are not  sure--and  anyconclusion drawn from  the  last  few days  would be  very preliminary--butto  the  extent  that  there may be something  to  it,  we  have made  aninterim adjustment to  allow  for that  greater reluctance  to use  thewindow these  last  few days  and have  been willing  to provide  morenonborrowed reserves accordingly.\\x0c1/8-9/80\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

STERNLIGHT.  Well, we\\'re  puzzled, particularly becauseduring the  first  two  weeks  of  this  last  [period],  as  Steve  said, itlooked as  if banks might  be  getting back to  a more normal  relationshipof  borrowing  and the  discount  rate.  And this  current week just  seemsto be  a little world of  its  own;  I think it  is  really too  [early]  todraw any conclusion  from it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  You didn\\'t  comment  on  the  excess  reserves, but  Idon\\'t  suppose  that  can  go  all  that  far.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  I tend  to  associate  that  with the year-endpressures  to  a considerable  extent,  perhaps more  than  the  newoperating techniques because,  after  all,  they  didn\\'t  jump  to  hold highexcess  reserves  right  after  October  6th.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.

That\\'s what\\'s  so puzzling, GovernorTeeters.  One would have  expected a response  of  a bigger  demand forreserves--that  is,  wanting  less  borrowing and more  excess  reserves--earlier and then getting used  to  it  later.  And what we\\'re  seeing nowis  an increased demand for  free  reserves  in  the  last  three  or  fourweeks  relative  to what  was  the  case  earlier.  In  some sense  for  anygiven amount  of  nonborrowed that we provide,  if  there\\'s  a biggerdemand for  free  reserves, we\\'re  going to  get  less  expansion  for  them[as  they]  go  into  excess  or  into  reduced borrowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  And much  less  volatility in  the  funds  rate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  that  may depend on  certain other factorslike  the  attitudes  of  people  in  the  funds  market and how  [they react]to  the volatility.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\n[CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Willes.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I\\'ll  just make  twobrief  comments.  I\\'ll  start  out  by saying  that  I don\\'t  pretend tounderstand the  procedures,  so  my comments  are probably way off  thethe  discussion one  reads  in  the  paper each morning where people  areexplaining what  happened in  the  stock market.  They  always have somespecific  reason  for why the  stock market did what  it  did.  I don\\'tthink we  really  know how all  these  demand functions--for  excess\\x0c1/8-9/80-9-reserves,  borrowed reserves,  nonborrowed  reserves--are  changing  in  theshort  run.  I just  don\\'t  think  [we  know]  anything  that  can make  usreach very comfortable  judgments  on why  things  are  doing what  they\\'redoing.  Going back  to  Henry\\'s  comments,  at  times borrowings  are  insome  sense  restrictive and  at  times  they\\'re not;  it  all  depends.  Ithink  the  banking  system can have  a net borrowed  position  for  a  longtime and not  feel  constrained at  all,  depending on an  array of  variousfactors.  So,  I just  feel  very uncomfortable with the  procedure  thatwe  seem to be  getting into  where we\\'re modifying paths  and makingadjustments  and so  on because presumably we  are  able  to  identifyshifts  of  a  kind that  I don\\'t  see how we  can  identify.  Now, I don\\'tknow what  the  alternative  to  that  is.  But  somehow  it  seems  to me  thatwe\\'ve  got  to work our way to  a position where we  figure  out  which  ofthese  things  really matters  most--nonborrowed reserves,  totalreserves,  the  base,  or  whatever it  is--and set  the  dial  on that  andthen  just  let  it  run  for  a while.  And  if  we  see  the  dynamics  that  weought  to  see,  that\\'s  fine;  if  we don\\'t,  then we have  to  go back  andfind  something else.  I feel  very  [un]comfortable with  the situationwhere we  think we  can operate  on a  reserves  basis  the  same way we wereoperating  on a federal  funds  rate  basis.  I think the  two  are verydifferent  kinds  of  procedures;  we  can\\'t move  from a  federal  fundstarget  to  a  reserves  target  and make  all  these  very refinedcalculations and adjustments.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  If  I may, Mr. Chairman,  the staff  feels  thesame  reluctance you  do  about modifying any paths,  President  Willes.In  this  three-week period it  was  the  first  time we  did  it  in  anyconsistent way during  the  twelve  weeks  this  experiment  has  beenrunning.  And  it  was  only, of  course,  because  it  seemed  that we had avery  clear movement  of  factors.  That\\'s  a partial answer  to  GovernorPartee.  We  did  [the  adjustment  of]  $175  million early  in  the  period,and as  these  factors  got  bigger  or  smaller we  didn\\'t want  to  adjustfor  small  changes  because,  after  all,  then we  would end up chasing  it--going up  one week, down the next,  and we wouldn\\'t  know.  So we  tryto  [adjust]  as  infrequently as  possible  just  on the  grounds  that  youmentioned, because  things  would tend  to  average  out.  However, whenthere was  a very clear  change,  it  began to  look  as  if  we had verylittle  alternative.  But  it  was  only because  of  very, very clearchanges,  we  thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  ROOS.  I wonder  if  some  of  the  lack of  dynamism or  someof  the  sluggishness  in  this whole  process  might  not  be  a reflection  ofthe  fact  that  large  segments  of  the markets  aren\\'t  quite  sure  exactlywhat  we\\'re  doing.  That  leads  me  to  the  question  that  I would directto  Steve  or  Peter:  What would happen if  we  specifically and publiclydescribed what  our paths  are--or  at  least  some  of  our paths--so thatthe markets  could adjust  to what  they know our  game plan really  isinstead of  feeling  that  there\\'s  some vague  thing  going  on that  they\\'renot  sure  of.  Their reluctance  or  lack of  reaction may be due  in partto  the  fact  that people  don\\'t want  to  stick their  necks  out  in themonetary base path  is.  What  are  the negatives  to defining  thosethings  publicly?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  I think  there  is  some  appeal  to  that,President  Roos,  except  that  in  a period like this  where we  felt  therewas  an overriding reason  for making  these  adjustments  in  the path,  Iwould wonder  if  in  this  whole  dialogue  to  the public  announcing  a path\\x0c1/8-9/80-10-and then  having to modify  it  could lead  to  considerably moreuncertainty and confusion  than  if we  could have some  understandingthat we have  to exercise  some  flexibility as  we  apply this  procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  As  this  process  goes  on,  Peter,  and as  we become alittle more  comfortable and  confident  in  the process,  would youanticipate  that we would describe more publicly and more  specificallywhat we\\'re doing?  Obviously, if  unforeseen circumstances cause  us  tochange,  we  could  certainly explain why we\\'re changing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  I would certainly hope  that we  can getto  the point where  we can explain more to  the public  about  the  generalmethodology  and how we  formulate  these paths  and  carry them  out.  Atwhat point we might want  to  or be  able  to post  the path on  the wallwhile we\\'re going  through a period, I don\\'t know.  I feel  it\\'s  tooearly  to reach  a judgment  on that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  [I\\'d make]  two  other points  regarding  [theissue]  you raised, President Roos.  I don\\'t  think publishing a reservepath will make  the  relationship between  reserves  and deposits any morepredictable.  I doubt that  public relations  [efforts]  would work  inthe  direction of  making that  relationship more predictable  because  Ithink  that depends  on  other  things.  We may want  to publish a long-runreserve path, but I think it would have  to  be  for  other reasons.Secondly, though,  if  we  [publish]  a short-run  reserve path--say forthree  months--I think we\\'re  going to  generate  in  the  markets  the  sameeffect  that  is  generated by the money supply publication.  Every timewe come  out  with our  reserves number, which we  publish once  a week,then start  arguing with themselves  [about what]  that means.  Theymight  say  it means  that we\\'re going  to  lower reserves  next week andthat means  the  funds  rate is  going  to  go up  next week, which may orfrom theirs.  And it  might generate  unnecessary movements  in  theimpediment  to  the  smooth  carrying out  of  operations.  Those are  theother  two  points I would add  to what  Mr.  Sternlight  said.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. TIMLEN.  Mr. Chairman, I must say  that  as  a formerdiscount officer I find my views very  sympathetic  to those  of  GovernorWallich.  I\\'m reminded  of  the  fall  of  either 1966  or  1969,  when therewas  a good deal  of  discussion as  to  why the  funds  rate was  so  low.  Inmy mind the  explanation that  fall was  that under some  program of  easyaccess  to  the  discount window related to  business  loan restraint,was borrowing  $1 billion  for about  three  or  fourstraight weeks.  And the  funds  rate  slipped, much  to  the  consternationof  the people at  the  Desk.  But  [the  reason]  was  rather  simple:  Therewas an  additional  supply there  against a rather  constant demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You didn\\'t  talk  to  the  people  at  the Desk,did you?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. TIMLEN.  Yes,  I did.  Spence Marsh  and I went  throughthat;  I think  it was  in  1966.  Yes,  we have had  some problems.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  They  got  an  extra billion  dollars?\\x0c1/8-9/80-11-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. TIMLEN.  Yes,  they  did.  I  think Governor Mitchell  hadsome  kind of  program  involving access  to  the window  if  a bank promisedto  be  a good  fellow  in terms  of  not being aggressive and makingbusiness  loans.  I  think  the  rate  may have  stayed  high this  past  weekbecause  banks  for  some  reason  or  other--maybe the  reason Henry cited--have not  borrowed.  So  there was  a supply/demand  factor here;  thesupply of  reserves  in totality was  less,  so  the  demand in  the  fundsIt\\'s  a question  of  the  chicken and  the  egg  every  once  in a while.  I\\'mnot  sure  which is  the  chicken and which  is  the  egg  in  this preciseperiod of  two  or  three weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, going back  to  October  6th,  I thinkyou wisely recommended to  us  that we  not  put all  our  eggs  in onebasket  in  terms  of  operating  on a reserves  target but  that weexperiment  for  a while with multiple  targets.  Now we not  only havemultiple  operating  targets,  we  have multiple  intermediate  targets  inthe  various Ms.  I wonder after  three months  of  experience  how thestaff  feels--I  guess  I would  like  to  ask both Steve  and  Peter--aboutwhether it\\'s  now time  to make  some provisional  judgments  on whetherthis  three-pronged set  of  reserves  that  you\\'re  tracking  is  proving tobe  useful  or if  you\\'d rather  have  one  single  target.  Another part  ofthe  question, going back  to  your remarks  on lagged  reserve accounting,Steve,  and how it  is  complicating--I guess  that\\'s  the  word  for it--your  job,  is  whether  in your mind  any case  is  shaping  up for  a movetoward  contemporaneous  reserve  accounting  to make  the monetary  policyimplementation more  expeditious.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  there may be  some  differences  [of  view]among  the  staff  on  the  issues you raised,  President Balles.  I\\'llrespond to  two  of your points.  I have not  thought  for  the  ten tofifteen  years  I\\'ve  thought  about  it  that  there was  ever  any use  tolagged  reserve  accounting, and  this  experience  of  the past  threemonths  reinforces me  in  that  judgment.  However,  I also have notthought  that  doing  away with a  two-week  lag is  miraculously going  tomake  it  easy to  achieve  the monetary aggregates  targets.  So,  while  Ithink  lagged reserve  accounting  is  not  a plus  in  targeting monetaryaggregates  through reserves,  doing away with  it  isn\\'t  going  to meanthat  we\\'re going  to  do better  than hitting  3 percent when we\\'re  aimingat  4.2  percent.  We  could  continue,  in  an  unbiased way, sometimeshitting  5.4  percent when we\\'re  aiming  at  4.2  percent--getting withinplus  or minus  a percentage  point  [or  so]  over  a  three-month period.In my own mind, and maybe  I\\'m wrong on  it,  I think that was  a  fairlygood result  from  the  Committee\\'s point  of  view.Secondly, I\\'ve  become more  convinced--this  goes  back  foryears because  I  remember  I spent  some  [time]  years  [ago]  trying  totalk President  Morris  out  of  total  reserves--that  in practice  totalreserves  is  the more appropriate  guide  in  the  short run, namelybecause  of  this  fatal  flaw  of  trying  to  decide what  is  the properlevel  of  borrowing.  It\\'s  very hard to  decide  that.  And,  therefore,while  I know we  can\\'t  hit  a  total  reserve  [target]  even without  laggedreserve  accounting  in  the  short  run--because the banks  can repayborrowing  faster  or  things  like  that--this experience  indicates  to methat  it\\'s  a  somewhat  better guide.  But  using  [total  reserves]  more  asa guide  automatically introduces  even more  interest  rate volatilitythan putting  emphasis  on nonborrowed reserves.  So  there\\'s  somethingof  a  tradeoff.  Those are  the  two  things--\\x0c1/8-9/80-12-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How are  you going  to  use total  reserves  asa guide  without making some judgments  about  borrowing?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  we\\'re  inevitably going  to  have  to makethe  judgments  one way or  another.  But,  for  example,  if  banks  aren\\'tborrowing  and we\\'re  on a nonborrowed  target, we\\'re  going to  fall  shorton  total.  If  we\\'re  on a total  reserves  target  and they are  notborrowing, we  automatically sort  of  have  to  put  in more nonborrowedreserves  and we would  come up  to  our  total  target.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  they  are not  borrowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  If  they  are not  borrowing.  It\\'s  simply likethat.  We,  of course, will always  have  these kinds of  judgments  tomake.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  Steve,  do  I assume your  absence of  any commentson  the base to mean  that you haven\\'t really been paying all  that muchattention to  it?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  To  be perfectly  frank, we\\'ve paid no  attentionto  the base  in  the process but we\\'ve paid attention  to  currency.That\\'s because  if  currency were  falling short  persistently as  it didlast  time--if  it  fell  short  $500  million, then  that would mean to menot  to  put  in $500  million more of  reserves because  doing  so  wouldproduce a multiple  in deposits  and way  too much money.  The way wewould do  it  is  that  we\\'d say currency  is  falling  short  $500 million,16  percent  is  the marginal  reserve requirement  on demand deposits,  andthat  means  to make  up  for  that we would have  to  put  in  $80  millionmore  total  reserves.  If  that were happening persistently, we\\'d haveto  adjust  our path for  total  reserves  up  by  $80  million  to make up forit.  So,  while not really paying any attention  to  the base  in  anoperating  sense,  we  are  trying to pay attention  to  currency as well  asnon-member  deposits  to  see  that  our total  reserve path is  properlyadjusted to  come close  to  what  the  Committee wants  for money growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  You\\'d want  to  substitute $500  million  indeposits  for  the  $500  million shortfall  in  currency.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Right,  so we\\'d use  a fraction of  the  reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  Well,  I\\'d point  out  that  our debate  about  totalreserves  dates back  to  1969,  which tells  you how long we\\'ve beenthrashing around  this problem.  But  we  shouldn\\'t be  too  impatient withthis.  We  have  a lot  to  learn about how  to  run this  system.  Icertainly don\\'t  feel  the way Mark does  that  the  adjustments  to  thenonborrowed path were wrong.  I think  it would have been wrong to  havepermitted an  even greater  deviation of  total  reserves  from the pathneeded to  produce  [the  desired growth  in]  the  aggregates.  And  just aswe are  learning,  the commercial  banks  are going  through a learningphase now.  I think  that  $600  million of  borrowing  is  an aberration,which we  are not  going  to  find  in  future periods once  the moneymanagers  of  the banks  have adapted  themselves  to  this  new operatingprocedure.  I met with  a group of  them a couple  of  weeks ago  and Ifound  them in a great  state  of  confusion as  to how  they ought  tomanage  their affairs  in this new regime.  So we\\'re both  in a learningphase;  and I think we  can get  back  to more predictable commercial bank\\x0c1/8-9/80-13-behavior  once the money managers  begin to  learn  how others  behave  inthis  new regime.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we  have  to make  some  decision and wemight  as  well dispose  of  it  now, if  we  can,  as  to how  to  proceed atleast until  the next meeting, but  I would presume  it  is  going  to befor beyond  the next meeting.  We  are  clearly  open  to  modifications  ofthe  precise  technique.  Unless we want  to  argue  otherwise,  I thinkimplicitly we will  proceed with something  like  the present  techniqueuntil  [we  decide  to]  change,  assuming  the general  technique hassupport.  There  are  certainly aspects  of  it  that  have  to be  looked  at.I think  it\\'s  literally  true  that  only  in  the  last week  or  so  can wereally begin questioning why  the market  didn\\'t  respond  in  a way onemight have  expected.  And  that\\'s much  too  short  a period to  have  anyvery  [strong]  judgments.  I also  think  there must  be  some  element  ofcoincidence  in our  coming as  close  as  we came  [to  our money supplyobjectives]  in  the  sense  that  even  if  these  techniques  are better  thanI think  they are,  I doubt  that  each quarter we\\'re  going to  be within  1percent  or even,  as  with the December  figure,  off by  not much morethan  1 percent  of  what we  finally--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  That\\'s  right.  Well,  maybe  lagged  reserveaccounting  isn\\'t  the  impediment  I think  it  is.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  we hadn\\'t  had a nice  little bulge  inthe money  supply  in  the  last  published figure,  December  would havebeen a lot below  [our  objective],  but  I don\\'t  think  it  was  entirelyour good management  that produced  that  bulge at  that  particular time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Mr.  Chairman, I don\\'t  have  any problems withcontinuing on the  procedure.  I do  think  there\\'s  some  question  as  towhether  the  Committee would wish to  leave with  the Manager  and whoeverelse  is  guiding  this  the  right  to  change  the  nonborrowed path byexceptionally  large amounts.  The  amount  it  was  changed  this  timedoesn\\'t  bother me,  but  I can  see  a possibility where  the  shortfallmight be  a half billion  to  a billion dollars.  It  seems  to me  thatshould be  the  Committee\\'s  decision, not  a Desk decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  return  to  that.  On  the verygeneral  question,  leaving aside modifications  of  the  kind you\\'reproposing,  I just want  to  be  explicit  about whether we want  tocontinue  this  general  type  of  procedure.  Obviously, we\\'re on  it  andit  has worked;  on the  surface,  anyway,  it  has  worked.  The results  aremore  or  less  in  line with what was  intended.  And I think  it  continuesto have  some  of  the  advantages  that  were foreseen  originally.  Whilewe  still worry about what  the  federal  funds  rate  is  doing when itdoesn\\'t  go  according to  our preconception,  we at  least  avoid making aconcrete  decision--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  We haven\\'t  [moved  the  funds  rate],  anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That\\'s  right.  We haven\\'t  done  it  in anydirect way.  I\\'m not  sure how many people  are  convinced they  know justwhere  the  federal  funds  rate  should be now.  Anyway, we  avoid  thatexplicitly.  On  the  other hand,  I would remind you that  nothing  thathas happened--or that  I\\'ve  observed  recently--makes  the money/GNPrelationship any clearer or more  stable than before.  Having  gonethrough all  these  redefinition problems,  one  recognizes  how arbitrary\\x0c1/8-9/80-14-some  of  this  is.  It  depends  upon how you  define  [money].  And thetechnique does,  I think, make  it  a little more  difficult  in  some ways,to  say the  least,  to  reconcile  some  conflicting  short-run  objectiveswe have  regarding  the  domestic  or  international  [economy]  or moneysupply against  interest  rates,  or whatever.  There may be  a time whenwe really want  to  see  interest  rates  lower or higher and  they may notbe  behaving  that  way, and they may continue  not  to  do  so  for  weeks andweeks  and months  on  end with this  technique.  So,  there  are  argumentson  both sides.  I just  want  to  see whether we have  a consensus  that wewill  continue  on  this until  further notice  anyway. We  need  to makethat  explicit  judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  I don\\'t  see  that  we have any  alternative.  Nothingseems  to have  been suggested as  a clear alternative  to  continuing  thisand monitoring  it  awfully closely.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  at  the  extreme,  obviously we  can goright back  to  what we were doing  before.  But  I think  it\\'s  fair tosay,  and  I don\\'t  want  to push  it  that  cleanly, that  there\\'s acompromise  every place along  the  line--on where we  set  the  interestrate  limits,  on where we\\'re  operating, and on how much exercise ofjudgment we put into  this  even in making  the  kinds  of  adjustments  thatwere made  in the  most  recent period, which obviously were  influencedby  the  fact  that  the  money supply and interest  rates weren\\'t  goingexactly the  way we  might have  expected.  So,  there  is  not  absolutepurity on either  side  of  this,  and we  can make various  compromises.But  as  a broad  thrust,  I think  the  question is  whether  or not  tocontinue basically what we\\'ve  been doing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Shifting back  from  a very  successful  experimentcertainly would be hard to  explain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Well,  I\\'d  like  to make  one  general  comment.The  experiment  in  terms  of  results has  worked very well.  I have noquarrel with that,  certainly.  But  I think it  continues  to  lay us  opento  the risks  of unexpected  and unexplainable  declines  in  interestrates  that  can  give us  great  trouble  internationally.  Now, we  canalways  say  that  that  is  appropriate--that  we\\'re going  into  arecession,  inflation is  coming down, and  it  is  fully appropriate.Nevertheless,  as  the  Chairman has  pointed out--he gets  this questionagain and  again and we get  the  same  thing  in the  press  and incriticisms  at  home  and abroad--that by  sticking  to  a firm money growthpath and  therefore  a firm  reserve path we  can get unpredictableinterest rate  results.  In  fact,  they may even be predictable  in  thesense  that  rates  become very  low when  the demand  for money lets  up.And we may or may not  want  that.  So,  I do  think we  need to  build  insomething at  the  lower  end.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  The  alternative  is  that we  go  back  tounpredictable  changes  in  the money supply.\\x0c1/8-9/80-15-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Well,  that  bothers me  less.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  I  think  one of  the  two  has  to  be unpredictable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  That  is  very true.  But  the greater  danger  ison the  interest rate  side.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They both would be  [unpredictable]  invarying  combinations.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  But,  Henry, when we  adopted this  procedure wewere  all  perfectly aware  of  the  fact  that  interest  rates  could  declineunder  it  and  that  they would be determined  by market  factors.  I thinkit\\'s  more  a problem  of your  educating your  foreign  compatriots  aboutthe procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Well,  we\\'re working hard at  that.  Every speechcontains  the  same  things  that  I said  just now.  And  sometimes  I almostbelieve  them!  [Laughter]\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don\\'t  think  this  is  absolutelyblack and white.  For purposes  of moving  ahead  at  the moment,  [let\\'sassume we will  do]  something like what we\\'ve been doing and  let\\'s  getto  Phil\\'s  question and maybe  some others.  But  in the broader  sense,  Itake  it  there\\'s  a consensus  at  the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVERAL.  Right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Now, I don\\'t know whether we want  to dealwith  Phil\\'s  particular  question.  It\\'s  a matter  of  judgment  as  towhether  or not  a big  enough adjustment  is  being made  that  it  should bebrought  back to  the  Committee.  I wouldn\\'t  anticipate  adjustments  asbig as  you\\'re  suggesting.  If  we\\'re going  to meet  as  frequently aswe\\'ve been meeting, because  the Committee  is  [conversant]  with  theprecise  techniques we\\'ve been using, we can  express  some  judgment  whenwe\\'re meeting.  I  suppose  it\\'s  theoretically possible--and  I don\\'tknow whether you have  any  answer  other  than  to  leave  it  to my  judgmentessentially--to say  that when  the  confusion gets  great  enough we wouldwant a Committee meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Well,  we  could have  limits  similar to what  we doon  foreign  currency  [operations].\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Similar  to  the  international.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  The  only  trouble  is  that  I don\\'t  have  any  senseat  this  point of  what  those  limits  ought  to  be;  and  I think  it  wouldtake  a staff  paper  to  indicate  what might be  the  tendencies.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we could be  very  arbitrary and  saythat  in  some basic  sense we  are  interested  in  something  like  totalreserves now but  the  operating  [variable]  tends  to be  nonborrowedreserves.  We can make  a path  for nonborrowed  reserves  at  the  time  ofthe Committee meeting  and  say we  can\\'t  deviate  from it  by more  than\"x\" without  [further  consultation].  I don\\'t know whether you want todo  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  What\\'s  a  reasonable  \"x\"?\\x0c1/8-9/80-16-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  But with nonborrowed it\\'s  zero.  The bigdeviation  is  in borrowing  and--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  No, nonborrowed  is  zero  after they\\'ve made  anadjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman,  I think  the  solution is  that  theCommittee\\'s  directive  should be  on  the basis  of  total  reserves,  andthe Manager  should be  allowed to  vary the  nonborrowed objective  inorder  to  achieve  the  total  reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That\\'s  basically the  way I interpret  itnow.  That  is  the presumption  under which we\\'re  operating but,  ofcourse,  the  total  reserves  are  not very  controllable and thenonborrowed reserves  are.  The  question  is  how much we should changethe  nonborrowed to  try  to produce  the  total,  which is  the  basicvariable  that  affects  the money supply.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  We  could have a situation  in which  theborrowing  reverses  its  present course  and jumps up  to  $1.8  billion.Then would you  cut  back  on the  net borrowed path by  $1 billion?  Istrongly  doubt  that  the  Committee would want to  do  that  right away,but--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, you\\'re  making an  assumption that  theborrowings go  up, the  reverse of  the present  [situation],  and  thatthey go  up without  interest rates  increasing particularly  in theprocess.  Now they are  going down without  interest  rates  decreasing.If  borrowings  go way up without  rates  increasing,  just  reverse  thestaff\\'s  judgment:  They presumably would be moving  in the  oppositedirection  if  that  literally happened.  If we have  a big  expansion  inborrowing, it would decrease pressure on  the market;  and if  the moneysupply were  running high,  the  Desk presumably would make  the oppositeadjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  I guess you\\'re  crossing  the  bridge  that  thereis  a good explanation as  to  why the  borrowings  dropped from  $1.7billion  down  to  $800 million.  That\\'s  a $1 billion drop  and  I\\'m not  atall  sure  that  the--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it\\'s  not  the  drop  in  borrowingsitself.  The  borrowings would come  out where they  estimated, assumingthey have a correct  estimate of  total  reserves with  lagged reserveaccounting;  and  [if]  they got  on  the path of  nonborrowed reserves,eventually  the  borrowings would be  forced up.  But  the  borrowings wererunning low with a high  federal  funds  rate.  That\\'s  the  confusing--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  Mr.  Chairman, we\\'ve gone  three months  and onlyhad problems  in  the  last month.  Like  Governor Partee,  I have no  ideawhat  the  limit  should be.  I suggest we  go  another month,  to  the  nextFOMC  meeting,  see what we encounter  and get  some  idea  of  how much thevariation  is  going to  be.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nSPEAKER(?).  Yes,  I\\'d do  that  too, but we  still  don\\'t knowwhat  the  limits  are.  I don\\'t  think we know the magnitude  of  theproblems  yet  and at what point  the problems become  a policy decisionrather  than a technical  adjustment.\\x0c1/8-9/80-17-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I agree  with you.  Well,  is  that  asatisfactory way to proceed?  I do think  that we  ought  to  put  on  thetable,  if  not now--and  this  is  under  continuing  review--any  ideasabout  it.  It\\'s  all within  the present  technique,  but  we might changethe  technique  a bit.  It\\'s  quite possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  I would point  out,  Mr.  Chairman, that  theelement  of  luck  and coincidence  in here  has  a lot  to  do with  laggedreserve accounting.  I may be  safeguarding  the  staff\\'s view becausewhat  happens  to  deposits  this  week does not  have  an awful  lot  to  dowith what  we  do with reserves  this  week.  It  has  something  to do  withinterest  rates  this week, so  there  is  that  element  of  luck andcoincidence.  If  we didn\\'t  have  lagged reserve  accounting, we\\'d havemore  real  problems  that  might  emerge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Presumably the  staff,  despite Mr.Axilrod\\'s  predilections,  is  busily working in a neutral  and  unbiasedway  to  present us with  some  recommendations  on  lagged reserveaccounting.  That will  be before  the  next meeting or  about  the  time  ofthe  next meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  [The  issue]  will be before  the Board beforethis  month  is  out.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  I\\'d  just  like  to  indicate  that  I have  a lot  ofsympathy  for  what  Governor Coldwell  was  saying.  I think we need totry  to  get a  feel  for what  the  limits  are;  and  the only way to do  thatis  somehow  to  decide  which of  the  reserve  targets  is  really  relevant.If  you think  total reserves  is the  relevant reserve  target,  then  thetolerance  limit  on  that  ought  to  be  essentially  zero and we  can adjustthe  others  however we  want to  in  order to  get--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  it  can\\'t  be.  The  dilemma  is  that  therelevant  target  is  total  reserves  but  it\\'s not  operational.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  It  is  operational,  but  it\\'s  not--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Not  in  the  short run.  It\\'s  operational  ina larger  sense,  but we can\\'t  make  that  zero because  we don\\'t  controlit  to  zero.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Well,  we  don\\'t  control  it  because  of  the waythings  are apparently  set  up.  We  can  change  things  and  set  it  up  sowe can  control  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We\\'d have  to  shut  the  discount  window;then  it\\'s  controllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Well,  I don\\'t  think that\\'s right at  all.  AllI\\'m trying  to  say, though,  is  that  there  is  no  arithmetic  exercisethat  one  can go  through  to  figure  out  these  limits.  One has  to[understand]  the  dynamics  of  the  system and what we really want  to  tryto  fix  and what we\\'re willing  to  adjust  in  order  to  keep  the  otherthings  fixed.  That\\'s  all  I\\'m  trying  to  say.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Even if  we  did close  the window, we  still  couldbe  thrown  off  by  currency  or  by  float.\\x0c1/8-9/80-18-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it\\'s  operational  factors  plusclosing  the  window that  make  reserves--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Yes,  but  it  makes  a whole  lot  of  difference  interms  of  where we  come  out,  not  just  in the period between  [meetingsof]  the  Open Market  Committee  but  beyond, how much nonborrowed  isthrown  into  that  package.  And  if  the  staff,  or you, or whoever  elseis  guiding  this  operation  is  throwing  an  extra billion dollars  in thepath, the  Committee  is  faced with  a fait  accompli  at  the  next meeting.That\\'s all  I\\'m saying.  If  the  Committee wishes  to  concede  that  to  youand the  staff,  it  ought  to  do  so;  otherwise it\\'s wide  open.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BAUGHMAN.  Well,  it  simply  implies,  does  it  not,  thattotal  reserves  is  our  overriding target?  And  if  that\\'s  true,  then  itseems  to me  that  it  doesn\\'t  present  any great  problem to  accept  aresponse by  the  staff  on nonborrowed  for  the  purpose  of  trying  to movetoward what we want  on  total  reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  But  I\\'m saying  that  if  [the  staff  is]  going  toenlarge  the nonborrowed path because  of  a shortfall  on  the borrowingside,  some money will  have been put  in  that  at  the  next  Open MarketCommittee meeting we\\'re not likely  to  get out.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Governor Coldwell,  the effective  constraint  onthat--the way it\\'s  structured now--is  the  funds  rate.  That  is,  thefunds  rate  constraint  stops  us.  In my view Mr.  Sternlight probablycouldn\\'t have  raised  the  total  reserves  in  this  last  [period beyond]that  $400  million  [in]  nonborrowed because he  would have been stoppedby the  funds  rate  constraint.  So  the  Committee--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  In  the  sense of  the bottom end of  theconstraint?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Or  the  top,  either  way.  You could  interpretthe present  directive  as  the Committee\\'s  saying:  \"Here\\'s where  theconstraint  is;  it\\'s  on  the  funds  rate.\"  Now,  that might  [not]  besufficient for you.  But  that  is  how  it  is  at  the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  COLDWELL.  I would doubt  strongly that  Peter  couldn\\'thave put  in  another  $400  million in  this  period if  he  had fed  it  inslowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  I don\\'t know  if  you\\'re  speaking of  thewhole period  or  just  this  current  week.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.

Well,  we  don\\'t know because  Steve  issaying  that  if  he had,  slowly or  fast,  the  funds  rate would have  beendown at  the  lower  limit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  COLDWELL.  I doubt  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  that may  or may not  [have  happened]  butthat  is  the  effective  constraint that  stops  us  at  some point.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  COLDWELL.

I assume  that  expresses  the  Committee\\'s will.If  the  Committee wants  to  express  itself  in  another way, that  is  ofcourse  its  privilege.

I don\\'t mean  to  disagree with you, Phil;  I thinkit\\'s  something  that  has  to be  looked into.  I would  disagree  with you,Ernie,  in  that  I think we  are  concerned  about nonborrowed  as  well  astotal  because we  have preconditions  [bearing on  how the  operationsaffect]  the  circumstances  for  the  next meeting.  But  that  all  has  tobe worked  out.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Peter,  would you have  done anything differently  ifwe had had a  10  to  17  percent  funds  rate  range  for  this  past week?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. STERNLIGHT.  Not  in  this  recent period.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  I thought  that  would be your  answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  I guess  there  are  always  divergent views  amongthe  staff;  I would have given  a  somewhat  different  answer  to  be  frankabout  it.  We discuss  these  things  all  the  time.  And  [my]  answerwould be  that  if  the  Committee  were willing  to  see  the  funds  rate  dropas much as  that,  I woud have been tempted  to  put  in  even morenonborrowed reserves.  On  the  other hand,  once  I saw  that  the  requiredreserves were rising against  that,  I don\\'t  think  I would have made  anyfurther adjustments, because  I  realize  the  Committee wasn\\'t  intent  onreally forcing money  out  like mad to  get  a  3 percent  growth  rate.Chances  are you might  get more  later.  It\\'s  that  kind of  judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  physicists have  always  had arather neat way of  dealing with problems  such as  this  by saying:Well,  that\\'s  an  engineering problem.  In  a  sense,  I think  there\\'s  agood parallel  here  in  that  the  Committee  decides what  rate  of  growthit  wants  in  the aggregates--that\\'s  the  problem for  the physicists--andthen it\\'s  an  engineering problem to  translate  that  it  into  the volumeof  reserves.  So,  I would come  out  very close  to where Frank Morrisdid  on  that  in  suggesting that  the  staff  ought  to  allow for  thesethings  in  absorbing  the  least  reserves  to  make their  best estimate  ofwhat volume we need out  there  to  support  the  rates  of  growth  in  theaggregates  that  we have  chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, we  obviously will  be  returning tothe  engineering problems  as well  as  those  of  the  physicists  from  timeto  time.  I think we have  an  understanding on  how to  proceed in  therest  of  the  discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.

I thought  you were going  to  quote  theHeisenberg  [uncertainty]  principle.  That merely  states  that  if  youobserve  it,  you automatically change  it  by  the  act  of  observation and,therefore, you can\\'t  possibly  know what  it  actually  is.\\x0c1/8-9/80-20-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  Catch-22.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Let\\'s  turn]  to  the question of  the  newmonetary aggregates,  on which  a memorandum has  been  distributed.  Mr.Axilrod, I presume,  is  prepared  to make  a few  summary remarks  on  thesubject, including  telling us  why the  different measures have moresubstantial  deviations  from  each  other  in  the past  than  in  theprojections  for  the  future.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman,  I might add  that Mr. Simpson,  whois  well versed in these  measures,  is  here  and is--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You probably were  going  to  say this,  butlet me  just make one  introductory comment.  We ended up with  the M-1Aand M-1B  [measures]  to  allow  for  [negotiable order  of withdrawal]  NOWaccounts  and  [automatic  transfer  services]  ATS.  As  it  turns  out,  inthe  current  estimates  there  isn\\'t  very much difference.  But  we  stillanticipate  that  there will  be  substantially more  difference ifCongress  goes  ahead and  straightforwardly authorizes  NOW accounts.The  theory here  is  that  ATS, which has  been legal  for a year, has  kindof  run out  of  steam  in  terms  of making  any difference, but NOWaccounts may well not  have.  So, whatever we decide upon  for  the  long-range  targets next  month, we probably are going  to have  to  go back andreadjust  if  Congress  does  permit nationwide NOW accounts.  We\\'ll  haveto adjust  both M-1A and M-1B, presumably in opposite directions.  Wecan  do that,  I think, consistent with the  substance  of  whatever weacted anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman,  I\\'m not  sure  that  I have  anythingextremely helpful  to  add  to  this  statistical material before  theCommittee.  I was  going to point  out particularly tables  4 and 5 onremarkable  thing  to me was  that  the numbers  for  the new aggregatescame  out  within  reasonable ranges.  That  is,  they  are not  numbers  thatare going  to  appear  strange to  the  public;  once  the  Committee  beginstargeting  on the  new definitions,  the  rates  of  growth  that  are  goingto  have to  be  adopted will  be  reasonable  relative  to  the  currentaggregates.  For  example,  on page  4, looking over  the  recent  10-yearperiod  from 1970  to  1979,  the  rate  of  growth of  the  new M2  of  9.95,  oralmost  10  percent,  is  very close  to  the current M3  growth  of  10.28percent, which  is  its  nearest  counterpart.  And  the  rate  of growth  inthe  new M3  of  11.08  percent  is  very close  to  the  10.64  percent  rate ofgrowth  in M5,  which is  its  nearest  counterpart.  Now, the  new M3  isrunning  faster than  the  current M3  because  it has  in  it relative  tothe current M3  large negotiable  CDs, money market  funds,  and RPs.  Butthat  higher rate  of  growth for  a new concept  is  not  so  out  of  keepingwith the  rates of  growth of  the  current  M3  as  to  make  for  considerableconfusion  on  the part of  the public.Similarly,  on table  5 on velocity, you can see  that  thecurrent  and new measures are  not behaving very strangely vis-a-viseach other.  That  is,  if  you  look at  the Mls,  for  the  new M-1B, whichis  again  a somewhat  different  concept  than  the  current M1,  the  trendof  velocity is  the  same.  That  is,  there appears  to  be a consistentupward trend  in velocity in  the current Ml;  if  you compare  the peak-to-trough numbers  in  the middle  panel  for  the  current  M1,  they  getlarger in  each one  [unintelligible],  so  the  trend is  toward higher\\x0c1/8-9/80-21-rates  of  growth in velocity.  We  see a  similar  development  in  the newM-1B,  even  though  savings  accounts  are  in  there.  That may change  abit  for  the  new M-1B  if  we  get nationwide  NOWs because we may  get  alot  of  savings  in  there  and that would  involve  a temporary  drop  in  thevelocity of  that measure  as  we get  a one-time  transfer  of  savings  aswell  as  checking  account  funds  into  the NOW accounts.  But,  again, Idon\\'t  think  these numbers  are  strange  relative  to  the  old numbers.So,  [I\\'ve  come  to  the  view]  that  the  transition  to  the new numbers  isnot  going  to  be  as  difficult  a public  [perception]  problem as  Ioriginally thought  it might  be before  I  saw all  these  numbers  laidout.Another problem  the  Committee may want  to  consider, when  thetransition  is  made,  is  to what  extent  it  wishes  to  operate  on  M-1A,M-1B, M2,  and M3  on  the new definitions.  At  least  until  there  arenationwide NOW accounts,  I would think you would want  to  keepoperations most  focused on  the  aggregate  that  is  most  controllablethrough  the  reserve  technique,  if  the  Committee\\'s going  to  continueusing  the  reserve  technique.  That  seems  to  me  to  argue mostly forM-1A or M-1B.  But when NOW accounts  become very important,  M-1B willbe  distorted as  will M-1A.  And in  that  case  one might have  to  fallback  to  a degree more  on  M2  and possibly M3.  But  I would  assume  atleast  starting  in  Feruary that  M-1A and M-1B would tend to  be  anindex,  unless  the  Committee  really wants  to  change  how we\\'ve beendoing  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Will  you weigh the  two of  them equally?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  under  the  current system, I think M-1Awould get  the  same  weight  that M1  now gets.  That\\'s  how I would tendto  interpret  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Every time we discuss  this,  I get verynervous  about  this  great  targeting.  Is  this  all  comprehensible?  Dowe have  comments  or  [questions]?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  I have  one  question  on M2.  I presume,  Steve,that  in  setting your compatible  ranges  for M2  for  1980,  you\\'reassuming that  short-term rates will  not  get  down  low enough to  produceany great  reflow of  funds  into  the  thrifts?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Exactly.  That\\'s  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  If  you  look  at  1975,  say, which was  a year  ofrecession, a year  comparable  to  1980  [as  projected],  M2 went up by12.3  percent  even  though I  think  our  1975  policy was  not  tooexpansionary.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  I think we  still  have  short  rates  and  evenshort  coupons  high  relative  to  the  fixed rate  ceilings  on deposits,  sowe\\'ll  still  be getting  the  funds  into  these  alternatives mainly in  thefluctuating rate ceiling  deposits.  We\\'re  not  assuming  substantiallydifferent behavior  for  now--some  increase, but  it  would be  verymodest.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  PARTEE.  But  of  course  in  \\'75  [rates]  fell  below thefixed  rate  ceilings.  So  even  the  passbook rate was  affected.

I just  wanted  to  say, Mr.  Chairman, since  I wasone  of  those who was  rather unhappy with  the  then-proposed M2  the  lasttime we met  and discussed this  subject,  that  I think  the newly adoptedM2  is  a great  improvement.  Certainly, the  inclusion of  small  timedeposits, which  are now incorporated  into  the new M2,  is going  to havea great  advantage,  as  I see  it,  of  reducing the interest  ratesensitivity  [of  M2]  over  the business  cycle.  That\\'s  largely becausethe money market  certificates  that  are  included have offset  thereduction that  otherwise has  been  occurring  in small  time  deposits.And I feel  pretty optimistic,  as  a matter of  fact,  because  if  we  lookdown  the road  I think at  some point we\\'re going to  get  a furtherrelaxation or abandonment--the  sooner  the better as  far  as  I\\'mconcerned--of the Regulation Q ceilings.  That  ought  to  make  theredefined M2  even  less  interest  sensitive  than  it  is now.  So,  I forone  am quite  happy with the  outcome  and  I thought  I ought  to make  thatclear,  having raised objections  to  the  earlier proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  For  similar reasons  you would object verystrenuously to M3.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  That\\'s right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Well, Mr.  Chairman, just to  start  this part  of  thediscussion going,  it  seems  to me--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I thought  it  was  just  finishing!\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  --that  we\\'re better  advised this  time around withthese new measures  coming out  to  settle  on,  say, M-1B and adjust  it  ifnecessary  later  on  rather than  try  to  straddle  an  average of  M-1B andM2  because we  don\\'t  know about nationwide NOW accounts.  I think itwould be  cleaner  and easier  to  explain  if we just  settled on  one[measure],  even  though we recognize  that we might have  to  make someadjustments  to  it  later on.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don\\'t  think  that  is  the  reason  thatwe\\'re  straddling.  We\\'re not  looking  at  an average.  It\\'s  just  that wepresumed at  the  time  that NOW accounts  would be  enacted and  that  thatwould produce a strikingly high M-1B figure as  it\\'s  now defined, whichwould have  been very difficult to  explain.  Indeed,  from our ownstandpoint, we  didn\\'t know quite what  its  significance would bebecause  a lot  of  [the  NOW account  funds]  will  come  out  of  savingsaccounts.  So  it provides  us with both an  easier explanation publicly,although it  looks more  confusing, and  lets us  know a little  more aboutwhat\\'s going  on  ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Well,  I think that\\'s  true.  But  I\\'m arguing alittle different point:  That  if we  get  into placing  a lot  of  relianceon M2,  a considerable  part of  which we would have  no  control  over,  itwill  give  the  wrong public image,  too.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  I think it\\'s  more M-1A and M-1B that we\\'recomparing, Bob.  The bigger  the  growth of  NOW account-type  deposits,some  of which will be  drained  from M-1A and some  from M2--maybesomething  like  50-50--the  bigger the  divergence between M-1A and M-1B,so  we  thought we  needed both.  The  one, M-1A, will  be  running  too  low\\x0c1/8-9/80-23-to  reflect  reality;  and  the  other, M-1B,  will  be running  too  high toreflect  reality  until  this  stock adjustment process  is  over.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  That may be  all  right.  Certainly no  one  in thepreceding discussion has  suggested that  we  average nonborrowedreserves with  total  reserves.  I\\'m just  arguing  that  we  ought  to  getaway from  this  averaging regardless  of which--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Old M1  with M2?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.

I\\'d  like  Mr.  Darwin Beck to  answer  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BECK.  M-1B?  We  have  [some  of  the data]  in process;  theyare  not yet  flowing  in.  We  have  the  historical monthly data  but weare  in the process  [of  putting  together]  quarterly data  and weeklydata.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We will  have  them  at  the  end of  the month,right?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BECK.  That  is  the  schedule.  As  far  as we  know we willhave them at  the  end  of  the month, yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Well,  I was  just  pointing  out  that  there  is  aproblem knowing what M-1B  is  going  to  be.  If we have  a  shortfall  ofdata, we may be  sitting here  next month wondering what M-1B was.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  PARTEE.  You won\\'t  have M-1B as  quickly for  Deskoperations, will you,  Darwin?  M-1B will not become  available  asspeedily as  M-1A.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  BECK.  There may be  a  somewhat greater  delay, hopefulynot  too  much greater.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But when  the  stock  adjustment  falls  out,presumably we  will  drop M-1A.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  PARTEE.  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  When we  start  publishing  this,  which presumablywill  be  shortly  after  the next meeting, we  are planning to  publishM-1A and M-1B weekly but  not M2  and M3.  They will be  monthly  [data].\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But M-1A  and M-1B will be  published on thesame  time  schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  Are we  planning  to  go public  with  the  nomenclatureM-lA and M-1B?  Isn\\'t  that  going  to  get us  some  laughs?  In  otherwords, I think either  M-1A  or M-1B would  be a  very acceptableaggregate, but  can\\'t  we  rename  the  baby M1  again and  explain it?  Ithink  every columnist  in  the  world is  going  to write  that  youeconomists are  fuzzing  this  up again.  Is  that  a problem or not?\\x0c1/8-9/80-24-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  probably is  a problem,  and  our  onlydefense  is  that  reality  is  complicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  If  you had your  druthers,  Steve, M-1B  is  whatyou\\'d focus  on now?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  It  doesn\\'t  really much matter, GovernorColdwell,  because NOW accounts  are  such  a  small proportion.  But  Ihave  a feeling--don\\'t  make  the  obvious  retort,  please--that  I knowmore  about M-1A than  I do about M-1B.  And until  M-1A declines  into  amuch smaller proportion of  the world  than  it now  is,  I would tend toprefer M-1A.  All  our models,  such  as  they are,  are built  on M-1A andhistorical  experience;  I just  know more about  it  and  feel  a  littlemore comfortable with  it  myself.  So,  I really  thought  it  was  a goodsolution, which emerged  out  of  the  Board discussions,  [to  use bothmeasures  for a while].\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We\\'d get  a very  funny M-1B if  we got  a bignationwide  movement  to  convert  savings  accounts into  NOW accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.

Don\\'t you have  a problem  of  not  being able toseasonally adjust  these measures because you don\\'t have  the  data  [onthe  components  that account  for]  the  difference between M-1A and M-1B?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  SIMPSON.  That\\'s  right.  Thus  far we  feel  that we  don\\'thave enough  historical  experience  to  seasonally adjust  the  othertransactions balances  that  go  into  M-1B.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  Basically,  the  quality of  M-1B  is  going  to besomewhat uncertain  for  a while until  we have more experience  with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  Well, we\\'ve had  a number  of  years  of NOW accountexperience  in New England;  I doubt that  our  seasonal  is  that  muchdifferent  from the  rest  of  the  country.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

When there  are nationwide  NOW accounts,  what wewon\\'t  know about  M-lB  is  the  extent  to  which and how  fast  its  velocityis  going  to  revise  downward, as  people  shift  savings  into NOWs  ratherthan just  demand deposits.  We  simply aren\\'t  going  to  know that.Similarly, we\\'re not  going to  know very much about  how much is  goingto  go  out  of  M-1A.  But  I feel more comfortable  in the  sense  that--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I  think a proportion  of  savings  depositsmoved  in  the  present Ml--after M1  got  squeezed  so much.\\x0c1/8-9/80-25-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  argue  forfocusing  on M-1A until  we get  a nationwide NOW account  bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh,  no.  I think the  way it\\'s  going  towork out may be  slightly different.  If  we  don\\'t  have  a nationwide NOWaccount  bill,  it\\'s  not  going  to make much difference.  As  the  staffshows  in  its  estimate here,  [growth in M-1A and M-1B]  are within 1/2percentage  point.  If  we get  the nationwide NOW account bill,  therebecause we won\\'t  know how much  is  coming  out  of  saving  accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS. TEETERS.  So will  M-1A.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So  will M-1A, but  I would guess  to  alesser  extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  Until  [the  shifting]  disappears.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  But we  can\\'t seasonally  adjust M-1B.  How canwe use  that  right  now?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  I don\\'t  think the  seasonal  factor  is  that  badbecause NOW accounts  are  a  fairly small  proportion  of  the  total.  Now,if  they were  1/2  or  1/3  of  the  total--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The more we  discuss  this,  the more  I hateto  say we have  a target  for  either one  of  them.  Maybe  that  is  a noteupon which  to  stop.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. GUFFEY.  Maybe  I  shouldn\\'t  say anything, but  would  it  bepossible  in this  transition period to  publish M-lA and  to use  M-1B asa memorandum item with  a notation  that,  indeed, M-1A will  be  replacedby M-1B when  the  transition period is  completed?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  we were planning  to publish M-1A  and M-1Bright next  to  each other.  I  really don\\'t  believe  large  problems willcome  from that.  Then we\\'d show a couple  of  other  items,  the  RPs  andthe  money market  funds  and go  on to  M2,  which will  include  the  RPs  andmoney market  funds.  The  difference  in  level  between M-1A and M-1B  isnot going  to  be vast until we get  the  nationwide NOWs.  And  I reallywouldn\\'t  anticipate  any--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I don\\'t  anticipate  that  there will  be  toomuch  trouble with that.  But  it  is  complex.  I  think the  complexity ofthis  is  inherent  in  the  facts  and  the  circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. GUFFEY.  But  it\\'s  particularly important when  theCommittee  expresses  its view  in  the  directive  to  the Desk  as  towhether  or not  equal  weight  is  to  be  given or  what we\\'re focusing  on.Thus,  it would  [reasonable]  to  put M-1B  in  the  public  domain but  as  amemorandum  item,  initially  at  least,  so  that  the public  and  the\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I  just  don\\'t  know how worthwhile  it  is  totry  to  guess whether  it\\'s better  in a memorandum item  or  the  table.We  may have  the  problem that  M-1A will  look very  low.  And would we\\x0c1/8-9/80-26-want  to  keep  publishing a  figure  that  looks  very  low without  having  afigure  along  side  it  that  looks  relatively  high?  I don\\'t  know how wecan  outguess  all  this.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Besides,  Paul,  it\\'s  additive.  M-1A plus  thecomponents make M-1B, which  then  goes  into M2.  So  it\\'s  logical  justto  extend  it  along  the  columns.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  I\\'m  fascinated by what  Steve  just  said  in  termsof  the  table  for publication.  Can you go  through  that again?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  As  I understand  it,  the  first  column  would beM-1A, the  second  column M-1B,  the  third column  overnight  RPs  andovernight  Eurodollars, which would  just  be  Cayman  Islands  Eurodollars,and  the  fourth  column would be money market  funds.  The  fifth columnwould be M2,  which would include  the  first,  third, and  fourth  columnsas  components.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  So  people  could construct any M  they want?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  That\\'s  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  The  other two  are  kind of  memorandum itemsin  a column  because  they have some  characteristics of  a payments--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  But you\\'re  not  going  to  publish  the  differencebetween M-1A and M-1B as  such.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  But  we\\'ll  have  all  the  components.  We\\'ll havea  separate  table with all  the  components  of  all  the  aggregates  aswell.  So,  that will  all  be  available.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. GUFFEY.  This  table  that  you  just  described will  bepublished monthly and then  there will  be weekly publications  of  M-1Aand M-1B?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  We\\'ll be  publishing  that  table weekly.  Therewill  be weekly estimates  of M-1A  and M-1B and  of  all  the  commercialbank components  of  all  the Ms,  including  those  in M2  and M3.  M2  andM3  will  only have monthly figures,  but  the  table will  be  publishedweekly.

This may be  just  a preference, but what werethe main reasons you were  reluctant  to  include  overnight  RPs  andEurodollars  in  the M1  measure?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  There was  considerable Board discussion  onthat;  perhaps  I should  let  the  Chairman  summarize  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I\\'d prefer  that you do  that!  [Laughter]Mr. Axilrod  is  being modest  because  I remember he  was vehemently  onone  side  of  the argment,  the  reasons  for which escape  me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Many members  of  the  staff,  including myself,felt  that  there was  a  large  investment  component  to  RPs.  That  is,  wefelt  that money managers  were not viewing RPs--to  an  extent  of  100\\x0c1/8-9/80-27-percent  or  [even]  50  percent--as  a  substitute  for  demand  deposits  butwere  viewing  them as  an  alternative  to  investing  in  3-month bills  or3-month  CDs,  depending  in part  on  their  interest  rate expectations.So,  therefore,  if  RPs  were  somehow outlawed, we  felt  that  only a  smallfraction of  the  money  in RPs  would be  going  to  demand deposits  and  therest  would go  into  CDs  or  Treasury bills  or  commercial paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Axilrod  felt  that  way.  Governor Rice,as  I recall,  felt  the  opposite.  It\\'s  basically a question  of  whetherthey are  actively  or passively managed, I think.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Our  econometric  evidence,  I believe,  is  quitemixed.  The  staff  is  well  divided on  the  subject.  With the  Boarddivided and  the  staff  divided,  the Board  came up with a very  judicious\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  Mr.  Chairman,  does  the  Committee not  feel  that  theabout  the  ability  to relate  to my friendly broker,  who  busted out  ofschool  his  sophomore  year!  I\\'m being  facetious,  but  isn\\'t  itimportant  to  make  an  effort  to be  as  clear  and as  simple  as possiblein  describing this?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think  it\\'s  an  important problem,and  one with which we  anticipate some  real  difficulties.  I take  aliteral exception  only  to  your  final  point.  The  effort  to be  assimple  as  possible may be misleading.  I  come back  [to  my view that]the  reality  is  complex.  That  is  the  difficulty we  are  dealing withduring  this  transition  period.  But  I think  it  is  a major problem,  andwe plan  to  have  press  briefings  and  so  forth beforehand  so  that  wegive  as good  an  explanation as  possible.  Now, as  you can  see,providing there  is  no  change  in  the  law--if  the  staff  is  right  and  Idon\\'t  know whether  they are  or  not--there isn\\'t much differencebetween the  two measures,  which makes  this  all  look ratherunnecessary.  But  if  they  are  right  and we have  nationwide NOWaccounts  [authorized by]  Congress  beginning  in March,  there\\'s  going tobe  a  significant  difference between  the  two.  Therein  lies  theproblem.  We\\'re  preparing  the way.  If  the  law were going  to  remainunchanged,  I\\'d  say dispense with M-1A  or M-1B.  We would go  one way orthe  other  and make  it  simple.  But  we  do  anticipate  a  significantdifference  if  we  have nationwide NOW  accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.

One more question or  suggestion, Mr. Chairman,if  I may.  I think  there\\'s a big  difference between what we publishand what we  target.  I certainly have no  problems with what  isproposed to  be published here,  for  those both  inside and outside  theSystem who\\'d like  to  experiment with  different versions  or measures  ofmoney.  I believe we  ought  to  think pretty hard,  though, about whetherwe want  to  continue to  target  four intermediate variables.  In  thepast we\\'ve had four targets:  Ml,  M2,  M3,  and bank  credit pro  forma.But  in practice  [our  targets]  have  turned out  to  be  M1  and M2.  Inpractice we  haven\\'t really tried  to  control M3,  and we have  justobserved what  goes  on  in bank credit.  The  Bluebook again sets  forthin  the various alternatives  four  different  intermediate  targets.  Ihave a strong feeling  that  that\\'s  about  two  too many.  I wish  somehowwe  could  find a way of narrowing  that  down to  about two  that we  reallyuse  in practice, no  fooling,  as  far as  decisions  of  this Committee  areconcerned.  I\\'m not  sure whether--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You don\\'t  have L on here do you, Mr.Axilrod?

As  an  information variable,  just  like M3  is  aninformation variable.  I would hope we  could have  some  discussion  ofthis  tomorrow before  we  make  even provisional  decisions  on  what  theranges  should be  or what magnitude we  ought  to be  talking  about.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I was  hoping  to have  a  little  discussionthis  afternoon on  that  subject--not necessarily on  that  aspect  but--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  Well,  if  I had  to  do  it  right  now,  I\\'d pick M2for  one  of  those versions.  I think having two variables  asintermediate  targets  is  really  about  all  that  is  needed and  all  we  canmeaningfully handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  Could  somebody  tell  me  exactly what  theHumphrey-Hawkins Act  says?  I thought  it  indicated Ml,  M2,  M3,  andcredit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  It  just  says  \"monetary and  credit  aggregates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  in  practice,  as we  go  along week byweek in  the  future we\\'re going  to  be on M-lA  and M-1B because we won\\'thave  the  data  for M2  and M3.  That  doesn\\'t  mean we will  get  an[overlap]  at  the  end of  the  month.  But when we\\'re making  some  ofthese weekly decisions  I  suspect we\\'re going  to  be biased,  just  by theavailability of  data,  toward the  Mls.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Well,  the  purpose  of  these measures  is  not  somuch to  hit  them  all  at  once,  which is  impossible, but  to  be warned  ifsomething is  going  off  track.  The  purpose  is  to  have  a  sense  of  therelativeness  of  the  things we\\'re mainly  aiming  at.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that  can  come  up  in  the  laterdiscussion.  Let\\'s  turn  to  the  long-range  targets,  again not  with  theintent  of  reaching  any decisions but  of  having  an  informal  exchange  ina preliminary way of what  seems  to make  sense here.  The  first  point  Ihad was  that,  in  fact,  there\\'s  going  to be  a  lot  of  confusion with thenew numbers.  That  point  has  already been made.  At  a  fairly  technicallevel,  this  alternative  1  in the  Bluebook  is based upon  some broadconcept  that  4-1/2  to  7-1/2  percent is  supposed to  be  the  same  as  thecurrent  target,  which is  listed there  as  3 to  6 percent.  But  thatmakes a  1-1/2  percentage point  adjustment  for ATS  and NOW accounts  andthat  would kind of  reverse.  In  fact,  these  are not  equivalent,  if  Ithink it  through  correctly,  [because]  for  reasons  I won\\'t attempt  toexplain  in too  much detail  the  change  is  small.I do want  to  raise  the  question  of what we  say--again wedon\\'t have  to  decide  now--[for  the  period]  beyond 1980.  There  arearguments  on both  sides  of  this.  The  extremes  are quite  clear:  Wecould say nothing  about beyond  1980  at  one  extreme  or we  could laydown a pattern beyond 1980  and  say  that  cross  our heart  and hope  todie we  really intend  to  make  it,  just  like we  intend to  make  the  1980one.  There  is  a  strongly held body of  opinion--perhaps  in both\\x0c1/8-9/80-30-[Congressional]  committees  but  I know particularly strongly in  theHouse  Banking and Currency Committee--that we  should not  only  say whatthe targets  are  beyond 1980  but  that  they  should  legislate  them.  So,I think  it\\'s  an issue  that will  come  up  in testimony  one way oranother.  And if  we  say something, we  should have  some  guidance as  tohow much it\\'s  a hope  or  how much  it\\'s  a real  expectation  or somethingin between.  My own  feeling  is  that we probably have to  say something;but that  leaves  a lot  of  room between  expressing it  as  a general  hopeor  a solid  expectation and  intent.  We  don\\'t have  to  give an  officialFOMC position, but  it  is  an  issue  that we  ought  to discuss  a bit.Let me  just  mention a few considerations  that  occurred to me.Given  the position  that we\\'re  in,  for  a variety of  reasons,  I think itcould be hard to  come  up with  targets  that  are  in  fact  or appear  to  behigher than those  we had for  this  past year.  I\\'m thinking notprimarily  of  the  fact  that  the  staff,  at  least,  is projecting  a lowernominal  GNP but  that  given  the psychological  and expectational  statewe are  in,  it would be  a big decision  to  have  a range  of  projectionsthat  in  substance was  higher  than we have been operating with.Secondly, and I go  back to  the  discussion about  the  targets we  hadjust  3 minutes ago,  there  is  among other  factors the  arbitrary natureof  the  targets.  More  importantly--well, it  may not  be more  importantbut  equally important--given  the  uncertainty that  I at  least  perceivein the  economic  outlook for  a variety of  reasons,  I think there  is  aquestion  as  to  how wide a range we want.  We  have been  operating withfairly wide ranges  of  3 percent.  We have  to  consider whether we wantto  narrow those  ranges.  There  are pretty persuasive  reasons,  giventhe uncertainties regarding both the  definitions  and the  outlook, whyit\\'s wise  to have  a significant range.  As  a part  of  that  issue,  thereis  a question of  what we mean by the  range:  whether the middle  of  therange does  reflect  some  central  tendency  of what we  think  isappropriate on  the basis  of what we  know now.  But  there  is  adifference between  attaching some very great  significance  to  themiddle of  the  range  as  opposed  to  saying that  in  the  light  of  all  theuncertainties we  may well  feel,  as  the  year progresses,  that  it wouldbe  quite  reasonable  [for  growth]  to be  toward  the  lower  end of  therange.  That\\'s  a decision,  obviously, that  can be  reviewed as  we goalong.  But how we  treat  that  is  of  some  significance.I did not  intend  to  discuss  the  economic  outlook extensivelyright  now, although  logically  [the  agenda]  may be  in  the  reverseorder.  That will  be  on  the  front  of  the  agenda  tomorrow when weactually have  to  make  a decision  about  the  short-run ranges.  As  youknow,  for what  it\\'s  worth, the  staff  is  projecting a 7 percentincrease  in nominal GNP  [for  the year],  but  [the  increase]  is  rathersmall  in  the  first  quarter and then  it  rises progressively.  That\\'snot  a pejorative  comment.  [Laughter]  I indicated my personal view.There  is  a considerable  amount  of  uncertainty about  any  economicforecast.  But  it\\'s  interesting  that  there  is  in a sense a lull  interms  of  nominal GNP.  [GNP  growth]  is  quite  low  in  the  first  quarter;it\\'s  less  than 5 percent.  And then  it\\'s projected to be  about--infact  precisely--double  that  for  the  fourth quarter;  it  goes  from  4.7to  9.4  percent.  I\\'d  just note  that  if  we take  that  as  an  economicforecast  and we  attribute  importance to  historical  relationshipsbetween velocity and  interest rates  and all  the  rest,  if  we  have  asteady growth in money demand  the year,  it  implies  a very differentset  of  money market  conditions  early  in  the year  as  opposed  to  late  inthe year, assuming  that  those relationships  hold  true.  And there  is  a\\x0c1/8-9/80-31-question  as  to  how we want  to  play any particular  target  during  thecourse  of  the year  in  the  light of  that  or  other possible patterns  ofeconomic  activity.In  that  connection,  the Bluebook does  suggest--and  of  courseit bears very  directly on  the  decision  tomorrow  about  the  short-runranges--some  alternatives  [regarding]  the  question  of  strategy,  whichto  some  degree we  do have to  settle  tomorrow, certainly for  the  nextmonth.  It  can worded in various ways.  [The  issue  is]  whether wedeliberately  aim for  a pattern  of  monetary growth  [this]  year thatdeviates  on  the  average--whether we take  our  risks  in  variousdirections  as  the year proceeds--and how  that meshes with  anyone\\'sview on  the  economic  outlook,  the  interest rate  outlook, theinternational  side  of  the  equation, and  I think ultimately,  too,fiscal  policy  considerations.  In  other  words,  do we  just  want  to  seta  dial  at  one  extreme and  say aim at  the  average  throughout  the  yearand  see what  happens?  Or  do  we  consciously want  to  take  some  of  theseother  things  into  consideration  as  we  see  them  from month to monthwithin  the  ranges  specified for  the year?  In  terms  of  the  particularsetting  that  we\\'re dealing with now,  to  make just  a  few points,  wehave had more  strength in  economic  activity than we  anticipatedthroughout  the  second  half  of  [last]  year.  Certainly  it  continuedthrough the  fourth  quarter as  a whole.  I don\\'t  know what you  thinkabout  this,  Mr. Kichline, but  I see  that  Ms.  Courtney  Slater,  theCommerce  Department\\'s  chief  economist,  while  she  expects  a  recessionthis year has  now decided  that  GNP grew by  2 to  3 percent  in  thefourth quarter  instead of  1-1/2  percent.  I guess  she\\'s  getting  readyto publish a  figure  fairly  soon and  I don\\'t know whether  that\\'s  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  She  controls  the  staff  that  puts  it  together.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  When  is  that  preliminary figure  due--in  afew days?  Well,  I guess  it\\'s  due  out  in  a week or  more  than  a week.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don\\'t  know whether  that  [statement byMs.  Slater]  reflects  [the  number  they will publish]  or not.  They willget  some  more  information before  they publish  that  number, won\\'t  they?Do  they get  retail  sales?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Yes.  They will have  information later  thisweek  on  the  employment  situation,  and  they need inventory numbers.Inventory  is  important and data  are due  [to  come  out]  on January 18.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don\\'t know what that  reflects,  butit\\'s  in  the  same  direction  we\\'ve been  seeing of  [the  economy]  havingmore  strength  than was  anticipated.  When one  looks  at  the  businesspicture  one has  to  say, as  reflected  in the  fact  that  the  figures  keepcoming out  better  than  the  projections,  that  in  a  sense we\\'re prettyclearly off  econometric  patterns  and  other patterns.  That\\'sparticularly  clear  in  the  saving  rate,  which has  gone below the bottomof  anybody\\'s  ranges.  And  that\\'s  what makes  things quite  uncertain aswe  look ahead.  It  seems  to  me  that  there  are  a number of  explanationsof  why we\\'re  off  the pattern.  It  doesn\\'t help much  in projecting, butpart  of  it  must be a  response  to  inflationary expectations.  And we\\'vesurely had  our  share  of  international  disturbances  recently  thataffect  inflation  and  affect  the  dollar and  are visible  in  the  gold\\x0c1/8-9/80-32-price,  the  silver price,  and commmodity prices.  Obviously, that  leadsinto  the  oil  situation, which  has  a very direct  and pronounced effectboth on  inflation  and what we  think  about  the  business  outlook.  Thatsituation has  been highly unstable  and I have the  feeling myself  thatthe  next  few months  will  give  us--without  overdramatizing  it--a  kindof  important  last  chance  to  see  whether we will  get  some  balance  inthe  oil  market between consumption  and production so  that  there  isn\\'tcontinuing upward pressures  on prices  that are  going to  carry us  tosome  unknown  level  later  this year.  So  long as  the  spot  price remainsabove whatever the OPEC  official  decisions are,  which  are rather mixedin  themselves, we will  get  a very unstable situation.  And we  don\\'tknow how far  this  upward momentum in oil  price  numbers can  go.So  far  as  fiscal policy  is  concerned, all  that  I knowindicates  that  the  present Administration  is  going  to  hang  tough,  ifthat\\'s  the  right  phrase,  in  terms  of  any sign of  a tax  [reduction]program  at  the moment.  On the  expenditure  side,  I don\\'t know anythingmore than has  been  leaked, which is  that  the  total  is up  around the$615  billion level.  We have a higher  level  of  real  defense  spending.We  are projecting  some  real  increase  in  federal  government spendingwhich, if  anything, I guess  is  a little  low relative  to what  theAdministration may be projecting.  It\\'s  either  [about  the  same]  or  abit  on the  low side.  But  there  is  no proposal  that  I\\'m aware of  forany  tax reduction.  And I don\\'t  think there\\'s all  that much discussionof  it,  although  that\\'s  a little more  doubtful given  the  spate  ofreports  that will  come out  on  the  federal  budget and the  EconomicReport in  a few weeks.  I don\\'t  think that means  that  theAdministration is  not  aware of  the  case  for  tax  reduction ornecessarily would absolutely rule  it  out;  it  depends  upon theevolution of  the  business  scene.  But  I think  it  does  mean thatthey\\'re not going to  push  it;  they\\'re going  to  resist  it  and resistdiscussion of  it  right  now.  While  one has to  make one\\'s  own  judgmentsabout how Congress will  respond, that  certainly makes  [a  tax cut]  lesslikely at  the very least  in  the  short  run than  if  the Administrationwere  pushing  it.Looking at  the  period  since October:  On  the  one hand, whileall  the  financial  data  are within our  immediate objectives,  I don\\'tthink we\\'ve made as  much  expectational progress,  if  I can put  it  thatway, as  conceivably might  have  been hoped.  Indeed,  in  some  sense  wehave not made  as  much progress  on  interest  rates;  one might  have hopedthat  they would be coming  down a little more clearly by  this  time.Looked  at  from an  October point of  view, we  haven\\'t  seen  thosedevelopments  that might  have been  anticipated.  It\\'s  fairly obviouswhy not, given  the  international  turmoil  and the  lack  of more visibleprogress  on  inflation.  In that  connection, I might  say that  ifthere\\'s anything  I would feel  relatively certain about  in the near-term economic  and price  outlook, it  is  that  the price  figures  aregoing  to  look worse rather than  better for  some months, particularlyin  the  consumer price  index where we will  get  both the  impact  of  oiland the  impact  of interest  rates  from the  last  three months.  Themortgage rate  has not  been worked into  that  [set  of  rates]  in  anythinglike a full  way.  So, when we  look  at  expectational  factors  anddisturbances, whether here or  abroad, psychological  or  real,  I thinkwe have a hump  to get  over  for probably three months  anyway  of  higher[rates  of  increase  in  the]  consumer price index.  And in  one  or  two  ofthose months  I suspect the  increases  could be  significantly  higherthan  anything we have  seen so  far.  That  is  the  situation with which\\x0c1/8-9/80-33-we have  to  live  whatever  questions we  have or  whatever we  think of  thelonger-term prospects  for  inflation and business  [activity].With those  general  points,  let me  open  the  discussion  to whatpeople  think  is  relevant with respect  to  these  longer-term  targetsboth on  the  one-year  target  and  at  least  a  little  feeling,  althoughthat\\'s more  of  an open  question, about  what people  think we  should  sayin presumably more general  terms  about  the period beyond  1980.  Mr.Eastburn.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  I\\'d  like  to  respond in  three points:  One,we\\'ve been  talking  for  three years  or  so  now about  our basic  strategybeing one  of  gradually reducing  the  [growth  of  the]  aggregates.  Ithink your points  about  the  business  situation and  inflationaryexpectations and  the  image  are  exactly  right.  In view of  that,  itseems  to me  that  our  strategy should  be  one  of  gradually reducing  the[growth  of  the]  aggregates.  Rather  than  alternative  one  or  two,  Ilike  the  formulation  on page  11  of  the Bluebook, which has  the  fourstrategies.  And  of  those  four,  I like  number  four best because  Ithink we  probably are  going to get  a  tax cut  and  should plan a gradualreduction  [in  the  growth]  of  the  aggregates  in  light  of  a  likely taxcut.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  strategy  four?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  Strategy four  is  a progressive reduction  in M1growth  from  6 percent  to  5 percent to  4 percent  in  successive years,assuming  a tax  cut  of  $30  billion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me just  say a word here  and  I\\'ll  shutup about  it.  When  I  look at  these different strategies,  all  of  whichcome  off  the econometric  equation  from  the base  forecast,  I must  saythat  I have  great doubts  about  these adjustments  in  the  econometricequations.  I guess  you\\'re driven  to  strategy  four  because it  looks[good]  on all  the  numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  I\\'m not  arguing  the  numbers  at  all,  Paul.  I\\'marguing  the basic  philosophy of  proceeding  [with]  a  gradual  reduction.All  right,  that\\'s  the  first  point.  The  second point  is  that  I feelstrongly that we  should not  announce  that strategy  and specificallythat we  should not  announce  numbers.  I  think we  have a  credibilityproblem and  I believe  expectations hinge  basically on  policyperformance and not  what we  say, because  nobody will  believe what wesay until  we perform.  So,  I think we  should have  this  as  ourphilosophy but  should not  announce any specific  numbers.  We  can  talkabout  this  being our  intent.Third, we  should reserve  flexibility for  change  in case  wewant to  change  our  strategy as  circumstances  develop.  I was  struck,for  example,  at  the  precision that\\'s  incorporated later  in  theBluebook  in the  forecast  of  interest  rates,  assuming variousalternatives  and combinations  and permutations.  That  may be  aninteresting exercise but  I think its  accuracy  is  greatly  in  question.What we  should  do is  remain  flexible  enough  so  that  we can  change  anddepart  from this  strategy  if and when circumstances  require  it.  Butthat  should be  the  basic  idea unless  we  see  reason to  change.\\x0c1/8-9/80-34-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, you\\'re now talking about  1980  andbeyond.

We have  enough problems  projecting out  1 year let  alone3 years.  To box ourselves  in by  saying we\\'re going  to  come down tocertain levels by 1982  is  an unnecessary  restraint and an unnecessarydanger.  We may have  that  intention, but  there\\'s  enough variability  inthis  economy that  we  shouldn\\'t  go  out  on  that  limb;  we  should  continueto  do  it  by performance.  I\\'m not  sure  I even want  to  talk too  muchabout  what we\\'re going  to  do  in  the  future--other  than  [to  say wewant]  to  continue  to  restrain  [money growth]--so  that  we have  theopportunity  to  change  our mind  as  time  goes  on.  I\\'ve probably donemore  5-year projections  than  anybody else  at  this  table  and I speakYou don\\'t  come  out where youfrom experience:  They\\'re all  wrong. say you\\'re  going to  if  you go  down  that  line.  I strongly oppose anypublication or any commitment  to  a specific number  for  future years.I wouldn\\'t narrow the  ranges.  We  have  a difficult year ahead of usand I think we will  need all  the  space we  can get.  For thealternatives,  a midpoint somewhere around  5 to  5-1/2  percent  isprobably the  appropriate way to  go.I would like  to  bring up  one  thing that  bothers  me  a little.A year ago we were  in much the  same position.  We  had the money supplydown--in  fact,  going negative--and I\\'m not  sure any of  us  reallyunderstands why the  money supply did  that between September  and March.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  was a demand shift!  [Laughter]\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS. TEETERS.  The econometric  equations  didn\\'t  fit.  There\\'sa strong  possibility  that  something  is  going  on  that  has  nothing to  dowith our  careful  reserve  management and all  the  rest.  We  just may bein the period  of  the  6 months when the money  supply goes  down.  And[last  year]  we didn\\'t  really have  a very good explanation  as  to why ittook off  after the  end of March.  So,  before we pat  ourselves  toogreatly on  the back,  let\\'s  remember that  aspect  of  it  and giveourselves  enough leeway to  accommodate  sudden spurts  on a monthly orweekly basis,  if  we do  have  them, and still  not be outside  our  range.\\x0c1/8-9/80-35-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SCHULTZ.  What  would  [your view be]  if  we  say on  thelong-range  issue  that we  are  not  going to  publish  any figures  butmerely say  that  we  are  on a  long-range program to  reduce  inflation  andwe\\'re just  going  to  set money  supply  [targets]  each year that  areconsistent with a  continued reduction  in  inflation?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  Well,  that would be  fine,  Fred,  if  we were  thesole  source  of  the  inflation.  But  it\\'s  like playing  poker with  theother players  always  pulling all  the wild cards.  We\\'re playing withOPEC,  and we  really have no  control  over  oil  prices.  To say  thatwe\\'re  consistently going  to  reduce  inflation  in  a situation where wedon\\'t have  control  over  inflation  is,  to  me,  going  out  on  a limb.There may be a time,  if  this  so-called  recession turns  very  deep, whenwe might  want  to  reverse  our policies  completely.  And  the  risks  onthis  recession, it  seems  to me,  are  basically on  the  down side.  So,  Ijust  find  it  very  difficult  to  commit myself  to  any  sort of  long-termposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Baughman.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  that we\\'re notgoing  to  have  the privilege  of  avoiding making some  fairly definitecommitment as  to  what  our policy posture will  be beyond 1980.  There\\'salso  a possibility of  getting  some positive mileage  from  taking  afairly  specific posture  as  to  our plans  regarding  the  orientation  ofmonetary policy beyond  1980  because  if  we\\'re going  to  be  able  to  makeprogress  on  the  inflation  front, we\\'ve  got  to  begin  to  have an  effecton  long-term contracts.  Such  contracts  have become  a  fairly  commonpart  of  the  economic  environment, particularly  in  the wages  sector.So  it  seems  to me  that we  should be  serving up notice  to  those whoengage  in  the making  of  long-term contracts  that  insofar as  themonetary policy environment  within which  those  contracts  will  be madeor  lived  through  is  concerned,  it  will  be a  changing  part of  the[overall]  environment.  And  it  will be  changing  in  the  direction theVice  Chairman has  suggested  of  trying  to  work  toward  lower numbers.And, as  I believed you mentioned,  if  we  don\\'t  say it,  there\\'s  a  fairprobability that  the  Congress will  say  it  in harder  terms  than wewould be  inclined to  say  it.  So,  I think  the  prospective benefits  lierather clearly  on  the side  of  saying  something  [about  the period]beyond  1980.  And what has  to  be  said  is  that  we will be movinggradually to  smaller  growth rate numbers  both  for money and bankcredit,  trying  to  make it  sound as  credible  as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You\\'re saying  you wouldn\\'t  give  numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BAUGHMAN.  I would not  give  numbers  unless  in  a  finalshowdown we have  to give numbers  to  avoid numbers  being legislated.But  I would go  so  far  as  to  be  rather unequivocal  in  terms  of  statingthat we  have  every  intention  of having  diminishing magnitudes  ofmonetary growth  rates  and credit  expansion  in  each  of  the succeeding  2or 3 years.  If  it  develops  that  it  is  simply not possible  to  live bythose plans,  I think we  still  might  have purchased somethingbeneficial  rather  than negative  on balance.  Furthermore, we  have theopportunity to  make adjustments midstream;  if  developments  come  alongwhich are  so  persuasive  that  we need  to make adjustments  midstream,the provision  is  there  for  that.  But  I\\'d be  inclined not  to makeadjustments midstream unless  the case  for  doing  so were  very, very\\x0c1/8-9/80-36-persuasive--so persuasive  that we would  appear just not  to be  in touchwith the  real world unless we  did make  adjustments.Now, on where we  come out  for  1980,  I find your observationpersuasive  that we  simply cannot  appear  to be  giving higher targetsthan  our experience  in  1979.  With respect  to  a specific  target or  arange, my own preference  since we started setting  targets has  been toset  a specific  target, recognizing  that we will  never hit  a specifictarget  but nevertheless having  something  specific  to  shoot  at.  Iwould  feel  in view of  the  great uncertainties we\\'re  looking at  thatthere may be  some benefits  to  a range  for  1980.  But  if we  were togive  a wider  range  than we used in  1979,  we would  lose  credibility.  Ithink  it would be  a mistake  to  widen the  range  of  the target,  whatevertarget we  select  for  1980,  from what we  had in  1979.  That\\'s  about allI\\'ll  say right  now.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You don\\'t want  to  say anything about  thelevel  of  the  target?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

Well, my  inclination would be  something  on theorder of  our experience  in  \\'79 with a downward tilt.  In  other words,if we  [adopt]  a range,  I\\'d put  the midpoint of  the  range below  theexperience  in  \\'79.  If we pick a specific  target,  I\\'d say the highestit  should be  is  the  absolute  increase  in  \\'79.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Coldwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman,  I approach this  from  twointeresting bases.  Number one, membership of  the  FOMC will  not be  thesame three  to  four years  from now.  In  fact,  if my count  is  correct,we\\'re going  to  lose  at  least  one-third of  the members.  I doubt verymuch if we\\'re going  to  commit anybody  out  that  long.  I think it  wouldbe  a mistake  to  commit because we\\'d lose  credibility;  in  fact we maylose  a bit  this year  in  [adopting]  a set  of  hard targets.  There  areenough uncertainties  and instabilities  in  this  economy right now thatwe\\'d better have about  as  much leeway as  we can get.  If we  followedErnie\\'s path of  selecting  a particular point,  then my aim for a pointwould be  something  like  4-1/2  to  4-3/4 percent;  [if  we set  a rangethat would be my]  midpoint with a 2 percent margin  on either side.But  that would  obviously widen  the  range  from  the  3 percentage pointsthat we\\'ve had in  the past.As  I look at  the picture  of  the alternatives  in  front  of  us,new definitions  and  current  definitions,  I\\'m not  quite  sure  Iunderstand all  of  them,  except  that  the  first  two  seem  to be  identicaluntil you get  to M2.  It  seems  to me  that we might  fudge  a bit hereand maybe use  3-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent  or  3 to  6 percent.  We had a5-1/2  percent  growth rate  for  1979.  If  we\\'re  trying  to  hold downinflation in  1980  and 1981,  I don\\'t  see how we  could aim for  5-1/2percent;  it  seems  to  me that  we have  to  aim for  something  lower.We\\'ve been hitting  the  tops  of  the ranges  or have been outside  them onsome  of  these aggregates,  so my preference would be  to  put  the  top ofthe  range very close  to what  I really want to  shoot  at  and  then  scaledown  from  there  and hope we  are  able  to make  some progress.  And if\\x0c1/8-9/80-37-growth came  out  at  the  top  of  the  range,  we\\'d have an  excuse  of  aworsening economy or  something  that  would clearly demand more  creditthan we had planned.  But  I do  think  this  economy is  so  unstable  thatit\\'s  difficult  to  know which way  to  plan.  We\\'ve  already  talked aboutrecession  for months  on end.  It  isn\\'t  here yet,  except  in  theautomobile  and housing  sectors,  and maybe  6 months  from now  it  stillwon\\'t be  here  except  for automobiles  and housing.  I don\\'t  know.  It\\'shard  to  see  how the  consumer  can continue  to  fight  this.  Maybe he  isgoing  into  dissavings,  but  somehow or  other he\\'s  keeping up  hisexpenditures  and may  continue  to  do  so  for  a while.  My preferencewould be not  to  talk about  1981  because  I think we\\'re  going to  getinto  a box.  I\\'d  like  a range  of 4 percentage points,  but  if  theCommittee thinks  3 points  is  the most  we  can get  away with, I\\'d  takethe  3-point  range  and I\\'d  shade  alternative  2.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Well,  I start  with  the  experience we\\'ve had  ofhitting  our  target  on M1  and getting  as  a result  a  severe  accelerationof  inflation plus  a much  stronger  economy.  We\\'ve been waiting  forthis  recession now  for  a year.  It was  predicted for  the  early part  of\\'79.  So,  this  leads  me  to  think  that  there  is  something  about ournumbers  that  just  does  not reflect  the  true  concept  of  money.  [Idon\\'t  know]  whether we\\'re  going  to capture  that  by our  revisions.  Ithink we\\'ll make  improvements but  not  really  capture everything  thatis  happening  in  the way of  rising  liquidity,  and  that  makes me  leantoward low numbers.  I also  see that  there  are  very ominous  changesgoing on  in people\\'s  habits  and expectations.  In the  last  surge  ofinflation,  1974-75,  there was  a worldwide tendency  for  saving  rates  toincrease.  That was  almost  the  same  in  all  major  countries.  I haven\\'tchecked  out  what happened  in  this period, but  we  see now what  happensto  us.  People have  a different attitude.  They  are  less  afraid thatthey\\'ll  lose  their  jobs,  but  they\\'re  more convinced that  inflationwill  go  on.  That  is  what  the  decline  in  the  saving  rate  seems  to meto  say.Now, as  to  action,  I share  the view that  we  shouldn\\'t make  anumerical  commitment because  the meaning of  that  commitment  isn\\'tclear  enough, particularly if  we had  to  start  with a  commitment  thatsays  6 to  5 to  4 percent  or  5  to  4 to  3 percent.  I very much doubtthat we\\'d hit  that because circumstances  could  force us  into  a pro-cyclical  pattern.  We\\'re not  going to have  the  desire  or  ability  tocut off  a  strong  economic  expansion, and we\\'ll  find ourselves  beingpro-cyclical.  Therefore,  I think we  have  to  start  with a  low rate  ofmoney growth  right  away.  I would  say  that  3 to  6 percent  is  a  goodstarting point.  If  we  went much higher  than  that,  we\\'d be  inimmediate danger  of  getting into  negative  real  interest  rates withwhat  they do  to  allocation of  credit  and  inflation and  the dollar.  Onthe other aggregates,  I\\'d  like  to  see more  clearly how  they are  likelyto  behave.  But  I  think a  fairly narrow  [Ml]  range  like  3 to  6percent,  aiming  at  the  midpoint  of  4.5  percent  and  expecting  that  thatreally is  a  symbol  for much more  liquidity than  it  seems  to  give us,is  the way  to  start.\\x0c1/8-9/80-38-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman, Governor Wallich\\'s  commentreminded me  of  a fact  that was  inadvertently left  out  of  the Bluebook.We  showed  the  actual  growth rate  of  M1  for  1979  of  5.5  percent  and  Imeant to  show also  in parentheses,  and did not,  the  growth of  M1  as  ifthere  had been no  ATS  accounts.  One would have had  to  add  1.3percentage  points  to  that  on  our  latest estimate.  So,  6.8  percentwould be  the  growth if  there were no ATS  accounts.  That  same  1.3would be  added to  M-1A, and its  growth would be  6.3  percent  if  therewere no ATS  accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.

Well,  we\\'ll  explore  that  another  time.Mr. Guffey.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. GUFFEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There  are  two or  threepoints  I would like  to make.  One,  on  the  discussion of whether or  notto  retain ranges,  I think there  is  comfort  in  ranges and  that we mustretain them  for  1980.  And I think a spread any narrower than thespread  of  3 points  that  we  have had in  the  past would be  ill  advised.Secondly,  as  to  the projection of  our  intentions  for  1981  and beyond,I would agree with the  comments  that  it  would be perhaps moredestructive to  credibility  than helpful.  If  we project  for  1981  andbeyond, we  would have  to do  it  either  [by  giving]  a set  figure ofwhere we  project  the money  supply to be, which  takes  us  out  of  therange  concept,  or by  saying that  we  are going  to reduce money growth 1percent  from  the year before, whatever that may be.  There is  realdanger  in  trying to  project  into  1981  and beyond.  It  seems  to mequite  appropriate, however, to  express what  probably would be  aconsensus  of  this Committee  that  our  objective  is  to  move the moneygrowth to  a lower  level  [within]  those ranges,  [namely around]  5.5percent.  That\\'s  still a very restrictive monetary policy  for 1980  asopposed to  1979.  That  would be moving from growth  of  7 percent  in1979  to  5.5  percent  in  1980,  which I consider  to be  a fairlyrestrictive policy.  I would like  to  recommend  that we  look at  a range\\x0c1/8-9/80-39-for  1980  for  M1  or M-1A, and  I think  they are both the  same,  of  4  to  7percent  rather  than  either alternative  1 or  alternative  2.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Winn.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WINN.  Well,  I would take  a  somewhat different  tack.  Youtalked  about  the  complexity  of  reality as  we  view the Ms  and  reserves.I  think  the  complexity  of  the  economy with  respect  to  the  outlook  iseven greater.  Second,  I think we  are  boxed in because  of  the  lawsaying  we  have  to  do  this  and  do  that.  If  I were  doing  it,  I wouldindicate  very clearly what my economic  scenario  is  and then what myrecommendation is  in  [that  context]  rather  than say  that  this  is  ourtarget  irrespective  of  what  happens.  I  suspect  that  the economicoutlook  is  going to be  far more variable--and I\\'m not  saying  on whichside--than any  of  the  projections would  indicate,  and  that makes  ourtarget  setting  even more  important.  And  I would offer  to  go  back  toCongress  at  an  appropriate  time because  of my lack of  confidence  in mylong-range  forecast  on  the  economy.  I would surely put  my economicscenario  out  there  if  I put  out  any kind of  targets.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

WINN.  Well,  that\\'s  correct.  But  [I\\'d  say:  Given]  thishypothesis,  this  would be  true.  For  example,  Paul,  go  back to  Octoberand  look at what you would have projected  on the  international  frontversus  what you  feel  now.  That  can change  far more  dramatically in avery  short period  of  time.  Let\\'s  assume  we go  to a military draft orassume we  get  involved militarily;  all  of  these  [projections  andtargets]  would be  out  the  window.  On  the  other  hand, if  we  just  takea look  at  our  inflation  rate  and what  that could do,  [the  recession]come unravelled  on  that  score.  Then we would have  to adjust  to  thereality as  best  we  see  it  at  the  time, rather  get  into  this  longerrange  kind of  set  up.  You  can  take  the  President\\'s  economic  outlookor  any  one  you want, and  say:  If  that\\'s  true,  then this would be  ourgoal.  But  because  we are  not  certain  about  these  things  we  are  goingto  have  to  adjust  as  time  goes  by and we  are willing  to  come  back andreport when we adjust.  But  to  get  caught  in a  longer-range  [target],even a year\\'s  target  at  the moment,  is  really  buying  ourselves  anothertrap.

Mr.  Chairman,  I guess  for  different  reasons  Iwould opt  for not  going  to  longer projections.  Frankly, there  are  somany uncertainties that  there  are  enough difficulties with  1980.  Andeven there,  I would hope  that we  could relate our  longer-run look  at1980  to  the  actual  targets  that were  in place  for  1979  and not  ourresults  or  our  experience  for  1979.  I would not  be  too  much forchanging  these  during the year,  even with  the  chances  of  recession  orOPEC  influences.  I think  [any]  changes  we are  going to  make  [in  theranges]  are  going  to have  a rather minimum  influence,  and I\\'d beinclined to  stick  to our  longer-run targets.  In  doing that  I have  apreference  for  looking at  those  associated with  alternative  2.Contrary to  what  some  of  the  others have suggested,  I\\'d be  inclined tonarrow the  target ranges, maybe  still  with 4-1/2  to  5 percent  as  themidpoint,  but  certainly not  wider than  4 to  6 percent  if  M-1B  is whatwe  are  going to  be  talking about.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I have  no  idea how or when  they may be  wound down;\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible]  proposing making  it  forthe  last  quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. TIMLEN.  Why not?  At  any rate, I think these  externaldevelopments  all  pose  threats  on the  side  of  impeding  our  inflationfighting efforts,  and  they pose a risk  to  the  strength of  the  dollarif  there\\'s  a renewed reason  for  a flight  from  [other]  currencies.Finally, I would agree with some  of  the people  to my  immediate  rightthat  a recession is  upon us.  I look at  the  auto  situation  and housingand  the cost  of  energy as  we  go  into  the  winter and  the  impact  onconsumers.  For me  inflation continues  to  be the  overriding concern.Inflationary  expectations  are  as  rampant  as  ever.  The  dollarcontinues  to be  vulnerable in  the  foreign exchange markets  to anyappearance  of  an easing  in our policy,  and  [market  participants]  dofocus on  interest  rates.  So my prescription as  of  this preliminarydiscussion  is  not  to  compose another dramatic  package  like October  6or November  1, but  to  restate  our  resolve  on inflation and commit  theFederal  Reserve  to  a reduced rate  of  growth in money and credit.  I\\x0c1/8-9/80-41-would avoid any appearance  of  an  easing when we  go  to  the  newdefinitions.  And we  should make such a  commitment  not  only for  1980but  also  for 1981.  I\\'d say  if we  need any countercyclical  policy weshould  look  to  the  Treasury and  the  fiscal  side.  I haven\\'t reallystudied the  numbers much yet.  I would  be  inclined  to  go  for  somethingvery close  to  alternative  2 on  page  8 of  the Bluebook.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  PARTEE.  First,  I would use  the  3-point  ranges  that we[But]  given  the  fact  that we  have hadhave  had.  As  a matter  of  fact,  if  I could, I might  choose  a  4-pointrange  as  Phil  [suggested]. ranges  of  3 points,  I just  don\\'t  see  us  broadening  them  out.  I wouldremind  you that  we  fully used the  ranges  this  past year.  In  fact,  wemore  than used it  in  the case  of  Ml.  Now, maybe  our new procedureswill make  the  variations  a  little  less,  but  I would guess  that  we mayuse pretty much  of  the ranges  this  year.  In addition,  I think  itwould be desirable  to  borrow  a little  from tomorrow  to have  [moneygrowth]  on  the  low  side  in  the  first  part  of  the year  and  on the  highside  in  the  second part;  therefore, we might want  [wider]  ranges  justfor  that  purpose.  So,  I would have  3-point  ranges.Secondly,  I would not make  any 2-  or  3-year  statementregarding specific  reductions  in  our  monetary growth rates  becauseit\\'s  unrealistic.  For  example,  take  this  econometric  projection.  Wewould be  saying  that  after unemployment  got  to  8.1  percent  we wouldreduce  the monetary  growth  rate  again and  then presumably after  it  gotto  10.5  percent we would  reduce  it  again.  I just  don\\'t  think that\\'s[realistic];  we\\'re not  going  to do that.  Indeed, I don\\'t  think we aregoing  to  reduce  the  monetary growth  rate  a great  deal  until  some  ofthe  things  that  are  adding  to  inflation tend  to  fall  off.  For  thatreason,  it\\'s  important  that we be pretty  conservative with  1980because  I doubt  that we will  be able  to  reduce  the  ranges much beyondthe  1980  ranges  that we  set.  In  fact,  I don\\'t  think  1980  will be muchof  a problem  in  terms  of  [growth]  being within  the  ranges becausethere will  be enough  of  a recession that  we\\'re probably  just  sayinghow low we want  interest  rates  to  go  when we  set  the  ranges  for  theyear.  So,  I would say  that we  ought  to  center  the  range  on 5 percentfor  M1,  which would be  an  improvement  over what we  experienced  [last]year,  and that would mean about  3-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent,  [with]  alittle more  on M-1B  and  the  other  ranges  in  accordance  with that.  Andthen  [we  should]  hold  to  it.  I might  remind you  that not  only do  weface  the  possibility of  recession, but  we may be  in  a semi-war[status]  and  it  will be  important,  I  think, to  have  a range  that  isquite explicitly  stated to which we  can hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  when you  say  \"hold to  it,\"  you meanconsistent with your  first  comments  about using  the  range  ifnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  that\\'s  right.  And, as  I said,  I\\'d  drift  alittle  low  in  [the  range]  in  the beginning with the view  that  growthwill  be rising  within it  later on.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Black.  I  don\\'t know whether we  willget  through with everybody today, consistent with getting  out  at  areasonable  time.  But  if  it\\'s  agreeable,  let\\'s  go  on a  little  longer.\\x0c1/8-9/80-42-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman,  I come  out  very  close  to  ErnieBaughman  in  feeling  that we  ought  to  stress  our  range  in  1980  and notindicate  specifically what  the ranges will  be  for  future years  butindicate very clearly that we  still  hold  our oft-stated  intention toreduce these ranges  gradually over time  until we get  them down  to whatwe  hope  to be  a noninflationary basis.  So  far as  these new aggregatesare  concerned, M3  is  probably the worst  because it  seems  to be  themost  interest  sensitive.  I think M2  is  going  to be  rather  interestsensitive,  too,  because we have  taken out  of  it  all  the nonnegotiableCDs  at weekly reporting banks  and all  the  large  CDs--whethernegotiable  or nonnegotiable--at  the  other  banks.  I would think, John,that would probably more  than offset  the  advantage  from  [including]the money market  funds,  but  I\\'m not  sure  about  that.  I believe  M-1Aleaves  out  an  increasingly  important part  of  the  transactionsbalances,  so  I would settle  on M-1B as  the best  one  of  all.  I wouldfavor narrowing the  width of  the  ranges.  We have  had 3 pointssuggested at  times  in  the past;  we have had  2 points.  I would  favor 1point  for  the  two Ml  ranges  and probably 2 points  for  M2  and M3,  whichI don\\'t  think we  can control  that  precisely anyway.  The main thingthat  I want to  do  is  to  set  these  targets below what we achieved  in1979.  In terms  of  M-1B, which  is what  I build all  this  around, we  hada 7.3  percent rate  of  growth in  \\'79;  I\\'d  say 6 percent might be  areasonable  rate  in  \\'80,  so  [a  range  of]  5-1/2  to  6-1/2 percent  wouldlook  about right  to me  on  that  one.  If  we can  explain  satisfactorilythat M-1A really was not  5 percent as  the  figure  shows but  6.3percent,  then maybe  5 to  6 percent would be  reasonable for  that.  ForM2  I\\'d  suggest  6 to  8 percent  and  for M3  6-1/2  to  8-1/2  percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Mayo.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman,  I find myself philosophicallyinterested  in the  idea of  reducing the  ranges,  but I don\\'t  think thisis  the time  to  do  it.  I think we need all of  the  flexibility we  canhave here.  I find myself at  least  at  the moment utterly  opposed togoing above  6 percent  on  the upper  end  of  our range  for whatever wecall  [narrow money]--Ml, M-1A, M-lB--for psychological  reasons.  Itwould give  a wrong impression abroad regardless  of  how much we  triedto  explain  it,  and  to  some  extent that  would be true  at  home  as  well.So  I come  back to  the  3 to  6 percent range  that we had, not  justbecause we  had it  this  [past]  year but because  I think we haveestablished some  modicum of  credibility  in keeping  [actual  growth]within the  3 to  6 percent.  We\\'re certainly very close  to  the  upperedge, but we  still  have  established a credibility which  I have  theimpression at  least  was not  achieved even by some  of  our more austerepartners,  Germany included.  I feel  that  this a restrictive policy.Like Willis,  I feel  that  the variability  of  the  outlook iseven greater now than  it  has been,  certainly in my memory as  a memberof  this  Committee.  That\\'s  one  of  the reasons  I wouldn\\'t narrow therange.  I would also urge that we  keep our  powder  dry until  we  see howthings are  moving along  six months  from now.  As  to  whether we want  tochange  that range,  I certainly wouldn\\'t make  [our  intent]  public,  andI certainly wouldn\\'t  stick to  3 to  6 percent  through, shall  we  say,hell  or high water.  I feel  very  strongly that  to use a  [number]  ofany kind beyond 1980  is  foolish.  I feel,  much  as  Ernie does,  that  ifwe  state  our  intention  in the  present  environment  as defined by  thePresident\\'s messages and  so  forth  and so  on, our  own analysis  andrelated  intention  to  reduce the  expansion of  money supply  further as\\x0c1/8-9/80-43-long as  the  inflationary forces  rage  as  strongly  as  they  do  is  as  faras  we  can go  in  talking  about  \\'81  and  \\'82.  I join Nancy  [in  her viewabout  long-term projections].  I\\'m not going  to  question whether  she\\'smade even more  5-year projections  than I have,  but we made  the  firstone on  the  budget  in  the  1971  Economic  Report.  It was  a fine  paperexercise,  and  the way  to  start  is  to  start.  But  I would hate  to  goback and review that  now,  even with all  the  adjustments,  and  realizehow  shaky  it  was  at  the  time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Willes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  My  wife made me  promise  that  I would be moreagreeable  in  the new year, so  I would like  to  say  that  I agree witheverything  that  has been  said.  I\\'d like  to  say  it,  but  the  fact  isthat  I don\\'t  agree.  But  since  the  hour  is  late  I will be very briefin  stating my disagreement.  We all  agree  that  the  outlook  isuncertain.  Where we disagree  is  whether  that  makes  any difference  ornot.  If  we  really  think  that  if  we knew what  the  outlook was  we  couldaffect  it  in  a systematic way, then we  end  in  one  side  of  the[corner].  But  some  of  us  have  the view  that  even  if  we  think we  knowwhat  is  going  to  happen,  there  is  no  systematic,  predictable,effective way  that we  can have  an  impact  on  it.  Because of  that,  onecan  end up with quite  different policy implications.  I  feel  perfectlycomfortable  in  the  abstract  in  saying  that,  yes,  the  outlook  isuncertain but  that  policy ought not  to be uncertain.  Policy  ought  tobe  a given,  and by making policy a given we  can  in  fact  reduce some  ofthe  uncertainty of  the  outlook.  The  implication of  that  is  that weshould not  only decide  but  should  specify in  great detail  what  ourtargets  are  for  the next  five years.  Unfortunately, we have  one minorproblem with  that,  which  is  that  a change  in  technology is  going on inthe  financial markets  that makes  all  the  numbers,  if  not  irrelevant,at  least  highly uncertain.  So,  since  you  have given us  an extramonth,  I would like  to wait  another month  and  then be  able  to  comeback and tell  you what  I  think  those  numbers  ought  to  be.  It\\'s  clearthat we  can\\'t  in  the  current  environment  spell  out  any M  for  the nextthree years  because  the  technology is  bound to  change  in  such a waythat  it  would make any  number we  specify obsolete.  It may be  that  weare going  to  have to  move to  some  kind  of  reserve  target  and  spellthat  out  for  three  years.  But whatever  we  do,  we  need to  find a wayto  reduce  the uncertainty of  the  outlook  that  is  associated withpolicy.  We  can\\'t  reduce  the  other uncertainties,  but we  can  reducethat  uncertainty.  I think  that would be  a  substantial  accomplishmentindeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Since  the hour  is  late, Mr.  Chairman, and sinceI don\\'t  really have any convictions  but only tentative  leanings  at  themoment, I\\'m not  sure  I will  give a number  either.  But  I would  like  torefresh recollections by  going back  five years when we  didn\\'t  have  tohave publicly  announced ranges.  Subsequently, when we  did announcethem, we  had  a very unhappy result  [after]  proclaiming  a  long-run\\x0c1/8-9/80-44-strategy of  gradual  diminution  in  monetary growth.  That  was aboutfour years  ago.  Psychologically,  [targeting]  gradual  reductions inthe ranges  year by year was probably good;  the  actual  outcome was  justthe  reverse.  Nearly every year the  actual monetary growth  keptaccelerating.  Whatever we do,  we have  to  avoid that  kind of  outcomelike poison,  if  we  give  any credibility to  our actions  of  October  6.I think we need to  stick  to  that  long-run  strategy and really make  itwork this  time.  We need  to diminish gradually the  rate  of moneygrowth, however defined, and  it\\'s  going to  be  more difficult as  we getinto  these  new definitions.So,  with respect  to  the  different  alternatives  that areoutlined here, with the  risk of  making  a pest  of myself,  I\\'m going  tocome back  to  the  theme  of  whether we need all  four  [variables].  Ithink we  are getting  the  cart  before  the horse  in a way, by trying  toset  numbers  for  four  [measures]  when we haven\\'t  really decided whetherwe need or  in  fact  can control  all  four.  When  I think  of  the  newcontent  of M2  and the huge  amount  of  savings  deposits  at  nonbankdepository institutions--deposits  that really  aren\\'t under our  reserveinfluence--and when  I think of  the volume of  money market  mutual  fundsshares  and so  forth,  like  you,  I begin to  have  some  doubts aboutwhether we  really can  control  M2.  It might be  important informationfor us  on which to  base  our other  actions.  But  if  I were forced  togive a provisional  number  for M-1A or M-1B  as  of  today,  I would  leanto  a midpoint  of  about  1 percent.  I\\'d like  to reserve  for  a moredefinitive--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  A midpoint of  1 percent?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  I\\'m  sorry.  As  you can  see,  I\\'m getting punchy;the hour  is  late.  Please  don\\'t  record that.  I agree with your[suggestion of]  a midpoint in  the  general  area of  5 percent  for  eitherM-1A or M-1B.  I think the  important  thing  is  to  demonstrate withinthe  context of  how serious this  recession may turn  out  to be  that,while we may have  to  depart  temporarily from the  reduction mode  duringthe  depth of  the recession,  the minute we  get beyond that  it  is  ourlonger-run plan  to  continue  this  gradual  diminution  [in money growth]in  view of  the  strength of  inflationary pressures.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I\\'m  torn here between the hour  andhaving  only three more names  left.  I\\'d rather  like  to  get  through thethree names  if  we can do  it  with great dispatch.  Mr.  Rice.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. RICE.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman, I don\\'t  see how we  can lookmuch beyond 1980.  As  a matter of  fact,  I would prefer  not  to  lookbeyond  the next  3 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You\\'ll  have that  opportunity  tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. RICE.  But  since  we  have  to  look at  1980,  I would  favorsome moderate reduction  in the rate  of monetary growth for  1980.Since the M1  range we would be reducing from is  4-1/2  to  7-1/2percent,  [whose midpoint  is]  roughly equivalent to  the  rate of  growthin  the  target  for  1979,  3-1/2  to  6-1/2 percent  would be  an acceptablerange  to  me.  I think the  range  should be  kept  fairly narrow,  at  3points.  So,  3-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent  would be acceptable.  I\\'d beprepared to  see  perhaps  a slightly higher range up  to  7 percent,  say,4 to  7 percent.  But  I could certainly live  with 3-1/2  to  6-1/2\\x0c1/8-9/80-45-percent  with a midpoint of  5 percent.  I know we are  supposed todiscuss  the  3-month  target  tomorrow, but  what happens  in the  next  3months  is  of  great  importance right  now.  And I think over  the  next  3months  is  a good  time to  lean rather heavily on monetary growth ascompared to  over  the year  as  a whole.  It  would have  good  credibilityvalue  and  I think  it  can be  done without much harm.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  By  \"leaning  on  it,\"  you mean down?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. RICE.  Down.  I think it  can be  done without much harm.It  will  be  a period when unemployment  is  still  relatively low.  So,  Iwould argue  for more  restraint,  or a rate  of  growth  toward the  lowerend of  the  range over  the  next  3 months  with the understanding  as  theyear unfolds  that  higher rates  of  growth would be  tolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Morris,  are you  feeling  brief?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  Very brief,  sir.  I think we  ought  to  be able  toshow a substantial reduction  in  our guidelines  for  [this]  year,  simplybecause  it  is  [likely  to  be]  a year of  recession.  It\\'s  a year whenthe demand  for money  is  going  to  be down.  And it\\'s  only in  recessionyears, in my judgment,  that we  are  going to  be able  to  reduce  theguidelines.  I can\\'t  see us  reducing them  in  \\'81  from  the  levels  weset  for  [this]  year  if  the  economy is  expanding.  As  a theoreticalproposition  I\\'d like to  see  [growth]  go  from 5 percent  to  4 to  3 to  2;but  it  seems  to me  that  if  we  don\\'t cut  the  ranges  back now for  \\'80,we are  not  likely  to cut  them back for  \\'81  or  \\'82.  Therefore,  I wouldgo  for  the  3 to  6 percent  [M-1A]  range  and try to  explain  to  thetime  explaining  that  it  is  a substantial  reduction because everybodyis  so  confused about  the ATS  add on  and take  off  and so  on that  theyare not  going to  be  as  impressed with  3 to  6 percent  as we  are.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Maybewe will  only  keep  it within our  own  family, but  it  enables us  to  makethese  decisions  in the  context of  economic  implications  instead ofjust  looking ahead  for  2 or 3 weeks as we  sometimes have  in  the past.I would very much recommend that we  announce--or that  at  least youannounce--as  forcibly as  possible our  intention  to  lower  our  growthrates  over a 3-year period.  I think  it\\'s  important  to  recognize thatthere  is  absolutely no  way in  the world other  than  by affectingexpectations to  anticipate a reduction  in  inflation  during thecalendar year  1980.  The  only possibility we have of  accomplishinganything along these  lines  is  to  make our  longer-term intentionssufficiently clear  that  anticipations  and  expectations would  reactfavorably.  It\\'s  vitally  important  in  the  world  in which we  live  thatour new--and I certainly  feel  proper--approach to monetarypolicymaking not be pre-judged with the  expectation  that we will  getresults  in  the  year 1980.  I think  that would cause  politicalpressures  that would be  disastrous.  Specifically,  I would recommend  a5 percent  [growth]  rate,  as  shown under  the alternative  2 descriptionon page  8, and  strategy  3 on page  11  in  terms of  1980,  1981,  and 1982.Possibly, if  it\\'s  unpalatable  to  think  of  actually putting outnumerical  [intentions]  to  the  world--and I\\'d say in  that regard thatour primary responsibility is  not  to  protect  our  own  flank but  to  come\\x0c1/8-9/80-46-to  grips with inflation and to  accomplish  these other  [objectives]--atleast  our  determination to  reduce money growth over  a 3-year periodshould be  announced and announced  clearly.

Longer range  I agree  that we\\'dbe absolutely foolish  to  set  specifics.  I do  think  it\\'s necessarythat we  say something  that  indicates  some  commitment  or resolve  ofsome  kind.

What were they up  in 1979?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  substantially less.  I think  for  theyear  it  was about  45  percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  How much of  your  8 percent  [inflation  forecast]would be  energy-related  then?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  it varies.  In 1981  it\\'s  a little  over apercentage point,  about  1-1/2  percent, and in  1980  it\\'s  about  2percentage points.  Let  me  just  say, as  it  turns  out,  that  domesticwellhead prices  in  1979  are  estimated  to  have been up  55  percent.  Theprice  of  domestic crude  oil  is  estimated to  have been at  $14-1/2  a\\x0c1/8-9/80-49-barrel  in  the  fourth quarter of  last  year.  Given  the  decontrolschedule  and our OPEC price  assumption, by the  fourth  quarter of  1980the price  of  oil  is  expected to  go  to  $23-1/4.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

KICHLINE.  We\\'ve  got  all  these numbers.  Let  me  just  saythat  lots  of  things  intervene  in  getting to  the  retail  price ofgasoline  including  importantly margins, which we have  assumed willshrink a bit.  Gasoline prices  are estimated  to  have  increased 50percent  in  1979;  [the  estimate  for]  1980  is  29  percent and  for  1981,15  percent.  So  the  rate of  increase  is  slowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SCHULTZ.

There was  an  announcement that  the  prices  ofhomes  declined some  in November.  We\\'ve been wrestling with  thisquestion of when we will  start  to  see  a leveling out  of  the housingcomponent  in  the  CPI.  Are  we  getting any better feel  as  to when wewill  see  some  impact?  Is  it  as  early  as  March, or are we  going tohave  to wait until  later before we  see  any impact?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  as  you know,  there  are  two  importantinfluences on  that  housing component:  One is  the price  and one  ismortgage interest  costs.  Mortgage  interest costs  tend to  lagcommitment  rates  by about  a quarter.  So,  what happened in the  fourthquarter  in mortgage  rates would appear  in  the  CPI measure  thisquarter.  Given  our  expectations  that mortgage rates  have peaked  andwill  be  drifting down, we  think that  by this spring  the mortgageinterest component  should not  have an  important  influence  in driving[the  CPI]  up.  In  fact,  late  in the  spring,  in June  or  so,  it  couldbegin to  operate  the  other way.  On house prices,  some  of  the measuresof  house prices recently have  declined.  Unfortunately, that\\'s  not  theinformation that  is  directly used  in computing  the CPI.  Our bestguess  is  that house prices  in  the  CPI  will  be  shown to  be  risingsomewhat  less rapidly through  the  next  several  months, but probably ata rate  that\\'s  still  near 10  percent.  So, we don\\'t  expect measuredinflation in  the  CPI  due to  the  house price component  to  be a helpfulfactor  in the  short run.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SCHULTZ.

I get  into  so  much trouble  when  I use  thatterm  that  I decided  to  avoid  it  today.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Why  is  that different  index used?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  as  I understand it,  the  index used tomeasure  house prices  is  an FHA  series.  It\\'s  based in  effect on FHAloans, which as  you know are  a  small  part  of  the  market.  It\\'sdesigned to measure  \"a representative house.\"  The  series  that  comeout monthly are  Census  series,  which  are based upon  the  turnover  ofnew and  existing homes.  And in  those  I believe  the average  price  ofhomes  declined a  little  in November.  The  question  is:  Was  thatattributable  to  a change  in the  mix or  in  fact  did  \"the representativehouse\" decline  in  price?  It  is  assumed at  this  juncture  that  peopleopted  for  lower  priced homes  and  thus  the  turnover was  concentrated insuch homes  rather  than  that  house prices  were declining.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  I was  wondering whether  the  staff  has  had  anychance  to  [develop]  even a preliminary view on the  likely  impact  oninflation  rates  of  this  morning\\'s  announcement  of  the  upwardadjustment  on the  wage/price guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  that was  pretty much  in  line with ourexpectations.  We have assumed  in  the  forecast  for  some  time now thatthe  wage/price  restraint program would reduce  compensation by perhaps1/4  percent  or  so,  or  a  couple  of  tenths,  but not  a great deal.  Ineffect, part  of  this  is  the  notion of:  Do you experience  settlementsthat  are well  above your  guideline or  do you  move  the  guideline  sothat  few  fall  outside  the program?  And,  that\\'s  a bit what  is  going  onhere.  It  is  a  flexible  guideline, as  I understand  it,  with a 2-pointspread.  We  expect  that  the  program in practice  has  been eased fromthe  restraints  of  a year  ago and  that  at  best  it  will  have a  smalldamping  influence,  but  not  [much].\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Your  projection of  the  average  earnings  increaseis  up  into  that  guideline,  isn\\'t  it?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Yes,  we have  compensation  in  total  running  inthe  9-1/2  percent  area,  so  it\\'s  at  the  top end of  that  program.  Imight  also note,  though, that  this  is  a  fairly heavy bargaining year.We  face  [labor  negotiations by]  the  steel  workers,  communicationworkers,  some  longshoremen, and the  aluminum  can  industry;  so  1980  isnot  an easy year in  terms  of  major collective bargaining  settlements.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

In  effect,  Jim, what you\\'ve  done by  therevisions  this  time  is  to  push  the recession  into  1980;  1979  is  nolonger  a recession year.  What  are  the  chances  of  [a  recession]  beingdeferred another  six months?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  That\\'s  not  his projection.\\x0c1/8-9/80\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  as you  know,  [those  chances]  are  clearlythere.  If  you  look back, we had assumed  in the  staff  forecast  that  arecession or  a downturn in  economic activity would take place  in thethird  quarter  of  1979.  We were  a bit  late  in coming to  the  recessionview  and,  as  it  turned out,  obviously not  late  enough.  It  is  possiblethat  we will  be  surprised.  The  outlook hinges  importantly on  consumerbehavior;  that by no  stretch of  the  imagination  is  the big  surprise  inthe  fourth quarter,  if  the numbers hold  up.  I do believe  that  theability of  consumers  to  rely on  reducing  their  saving rate  for  acouple  of quarters  to below,  let\\'s  say,  the  3-1/2  percent  level  beginsto  be  a possibility, but  it\\'s  very unlikely.  I also  think  that wehave  in  place now a clear downturn in  the housing  sector and weaknessin  business  fixed investment,  and those  factors will  tend  to  drive upthe unemployment  rate and provide  somewhat  less  income growth.  So,  Ithink  the probability  is now higher  that  economic activity issurprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Well,  Table  I-10  in Part  I of  the Greenbookseems  to  indicate  that you\\'re  forecasting a six-quarter decline  inpersonal  consumption  expenditures, heavily  concentrated  in the  goodssector--in  fact,  all  in  the  goods  sector--with services  continuing torise  on  a real  basis.  You\\'re  forecasting very heavy declines  [intotal  consumer spending]  in  the  first  three quarters,  tapering  offuntil you get  a positive  figure  finally in  the  fourth quarter  of  1981.What  does history tell  us  about  this kind of pattern?  Is  thisconsistent with,  say, the  1974-75 pattern?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  No.  What we  have  had often in  the  past is  asharper  slowdown, particularly in goods,  but nothing that  hasstretched out  for  six quarters.  What  is  unusual  about this  is  not  somuch  the  size,  but  the duration--that  is,  six  consecutive quarters  ofgood deal  of  that with  the  fact  that  this  expansion  and projectedrecession have very different  characteristics  than past  history.  Forthe  extended period  ahead one  of  the key  differences relates  to policyassumptions,  both monetary policy and, very importantly, fiscalpolicy.  There  are  no discretionary  fiscal  actions  in  our  forecast--infact  there are  tax  increases--during  the  downturn.  So we would[attribute]  a good  deal of  it  to  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I was going to  ask  a question  later butit\\'s  timely to  ask  [now].  You  have  a prolonged recession or  sluggishperiod here and you have no  fiscal  action  assumed.  You make  someassumptions  about monetary policy.  Would you like  to  comment  about  anappropriate policy mix over  this  period, looking six  to  eighteenmonths  ahead?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Sure.  In my own view, I think a posture  ofmonetary restraint  indexed by a rate of  growth of  the Ms  that  is  nohigher, and perhaps  somewhat  less,  than we had  in  the  last year wouldbe  appropriate.  I also believe,  however, that  action should be takenon  the  fiscal  side.  [I\\'d note]  two  important  aspects  there.  Onewould be  to  roll  back the  social  security tax  increases  scheduled in1981.  It  seems  to  me, in  some way or  other,  that  is  not consistentwith trying  to  gain  control  over inflation.  However, something like$18  billion  in  federal revenues  are  generated out  of  that,  so  that  byitself would mean about  an  $18  billion  tax cut.  I also think  some  tax\\x0c1/8-9/80-52-reduction that would affect  the  corporate  sector by  trying to providebusiness  investment  incentives would be  appropriate.  Realistically,it  seems  to me  that  such a package would be  in  the  $30  billion  area.But when one  thinks  of having  tax  cuts  in  an election year period thatdo  nothing  for  the  consumer  sector,  that  seems  to  me  rather  unlikely.So,  probably when we  are  talking about  a tax cut,  we would be  talkingabout  a bigger number  rather  than  a smaller  one.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  What  about  the  timing on  that, Jim?  Justrolling back  the  social  security tax  is  no  tax  increase rather  than  anactual  tax cut.  Isn\\'t  there  a possibility that  a tax  cut  in  thepayroll  tax,  say in mid-1980,  would be  appropriate  timing?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  That\\'s  quite  conceivable.  That would mean wecould avoid part  of  the  increase  that would be  coming along this  yearbecause  as  of  January 1 we  did have  about  a $4,000  increase  in  thesocial  security tax base and  effectively  for  consumers  that  will comeinto  play largely  in  the  second half  of  this year.  So,  that\\'s  right.If  you are  talking  about  this,  you do  not  think  in  terms  of  doingsomething  eighteen months  ahead but  rather  around mid-1980.  That  iswhen one would want  to have  this  [lower  tax become]  effective.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You have  given us  a scenario here  of  an$18  billion  tax cut  in  social  security taxes  and something forbusiness  and you  say,  realistically, something  for consumers,  too.

The percentage  change  goes up  by 2-1/2points.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would like  to  go back  to  thisforecast  of personal  consumption expenditures because  I think it\\'s  animportant  point.  You have  forecast  an  increase  in unemployment ofroughly 1/2  point per quarter  in  this period ahead, at  least  for  1980,and  industrial production is  only going  down about  2.3  percent  [in  thefirst quarter]  and  6 or  7 percent,  roughly,  for the  full year.  So,one wonders  a little  whether  these  are consistent with  the  decline youhave forecast  in  personal  consumption.  If  the goods  part  of  thisconsumption  is  going down at more  than  7 percent in  the  first  twoquarters  and 6 percent in  the  third  quarter,  isn\\'t  that  likely  to  havea greater  impact  on  industrial production?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  one  of  the  important points here  is  thatindustrial production is  only a part of  this;  what has  been drivingthe  changes  in industrial production recently has  been autos.  And weexpect  that  to  spread.  When you  talk  about  the unemployment  rate  andIP,  you  are  talking about  the bulk of  employment  outside themanufacturing sector.  The strong growth recently has  been  in tradeand services.  We  expect  that  employment  in manufacturing will  dropbut we  also  are going  to  get much  slower employment  growth  in  thetrade and  services  area.  Combined,  that  is  likely to  drive up  theunemployment  rate  relative  to  changes in  industrial production.  Idon\\'t  think they\\'re  inconsistent.  What we  are  talking  about here  isour view that we will  have employment  adjustments  in  the  short  runonce businesses become  convinced that  their  sales picture  has  changed.And labor markets  today are  still  quite  tight  in many areas,particularly for  skilled  labor.  Businesses  are unwilling  to  give  upskilled  labor resources  unless  they  are  convinced  that,  in  fact,  thepicture has  changed  for  them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Presumably  they get  convinced by the  end ofthe  second  quarter with a two  percent reduction in goods  sales.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  I think  that would be  convincing evidence,assuming that  our  forecast  is  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Well,  I think  the  emphasis  on the consumer  iscertainly appropriate here.  I would point  out,  Phil,  that  in nominal\\x0c1/8-9/80-54-terms  goods  expenditures rise  every quarter,  which I think makes  thepoint  that  consumers are being pressed not  only by  taxes  but  also  byinflation, particularly  the  inflation in oil  prices which doesn\\'treally have  a personal  income  counterpart  in  it.  The  saving ratebehavior  is  extraordinarily  interesting.  I calculate  that  in  \\'78  andthe  first  half  of  \\'79  the personal saving  rate  averaged  a bit  above  5percent,  fluctuating up and down but never getting much below 5percent  and being above  it  in  some  quarters.  That was  a period  ofrapid increases  in  installment  debt,  which reduces  the  saving  rate  ofcourse  from what  it  would otherwise be  since  it\\'s  a reduction fromgross  savings.  Then  in  the  third quarter of  \\'79  it  dropped  to  4.3percent with a lesser  rise in  installment  debt;  and  in  the  fourthquarter  it  apparently dropped below 4 percent  to maybe  3-1/2  percentor something  like  that  with a still  further decline  in  the rise  ininstallment  debt.  So  the question is:  In  terms  of  components, whatis  moving  that  saving rate  so  strongly downward?  I suppose  one  couldargue  that  if  people are moving  from  cash  to  goods,  the  financialsaving  is  falling off.  That would be  one  indicator.  If,  on  the  otherhand, there  is  a generalized  sort  of  squeeze  so  that people don\\'t  haveenough  income  to  cover  [their  expenditures]  and  there\\'s  an attritionin  saving that  results,  that\\'s  a different kind  of  story.  If  it\\'s  thefirst case,  we could have  a continued high  level  of  consumption.  Butthat  doesn\\'t  seem  to me  consistent with the  reduction  in  installmentcredit.  If  it\\'s  the  second case,  we would have a very substantialon  the  components  of  the  saving change, but  do  you have a view on whatis  happening there?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  I have  a view that  in  fact  the  economyhas  not been generating much real  disposable personal  income.  [Itsgrowth]  peaked out  in  December of  1978.  In  terms  of  the  monthlyfigures,  it bounced around but  in  the  second half  of  last  year,  forexample, real  disposable personal  income  is  estimated to  have  gone upless  than  1/2  of  one percent.  And yet we are  getting  expenditures,which we estimate,  for  example,  in the  final  quarter  of  the year  tohave been  at  3 percent.  Clearly,  in  our view,  it\\'s a strong attemptby consumers  to maintain  their  spending patterns  despite  adversefactors  in growth of  real disposable personal  income.  So,  it  is  thatsort  of  issue.  It\\'s  true  that  the  issue  is  wrapped up with whether ornot we  are getting durable  goods  purchases  [from]  savings,  and  thatwould tend  to  drive the  [saving]  rate  down in  a given quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  There  couldn\\'t have  been much  of  an  increase  incar  sales  in  that period;  they probably declined.  Were  other durablesstrong?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  some appliance  sales had been strong,but consumers  were generating  installment debt  increases  of  around 10percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  This  change  in consumer behavior,  as  I saidyesterday, strikes me  as  very  significant.  If,  now, in a period ofaccelerating  inflation people  don\\'t  save  more but save  less,  theremust have been some change  in  their evaluation  of  the  situation.  Themost plausible guess,  it  seems  to me,  is  that  in  \\'74 people weregenuinely scared.  They  didn\\'t know where  the  economy was  going  andwhether they were going  to  have  a  job, so  they  cut  back on average.Now with a more moderate recession predicted, there seems  to  be  less\\x0c1/8-9/80-55-of  that  fear.  On the  other hand, there\\'s  a more rational  attitudethat  if  they buy now  they save  13  percent.  They are buying;  they  didbuy cars,  which was  perhaps the  first wave  of  that.  Now they  arebuying something else.  You are  quite right  that  [consumer spending]seems  to  go  from  one  thing to  another.  But  I would argue  also  inlooking  at  consumer  debt, which has  risen  relative  to  income,  that  theconsumer probably looks  at  it  in  relation  to  future  income.  So,  withfuture  nominal  income  rising, the  debt  ratio  to  him appears  less  thanit  is.My main comment  is  on the  nature  of  our  staff\\'s  forecast.  Itis  in  a sense a formal  exercise because you don\\'t  give weight  to  thepolitical probability of  a tax  cut.  So  this  [forecast]  is  what wouldhappen if  the  things  that  are  already planned and decided were  tohappen.  The Board  staff\\'s forecast  is  under  those  of  forecasters  whoare not  bound by  that  constraint;  I think  those  forecasters generallyaccept  and expect a substantial  tax cut  sometime  this  year.Therefore,  the  shape  of  their  recession  is  different.  Their recessionis  shorter  than ours  and  its  end  is different;  instead  of  sauceringout  very  flat,  it  comes  up more V-shaped.  And their  inflationexpectations--although I don\\'t  know  this  for  a fact,  but  it  seemslogical  from  these differences  in  their view of  the  income pattern--should be  higher than  ours.  Can you  say  anything about  outsideforecasts  and the  like?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  I think your description of  those forecasts  isquite  correct;  most major  models do  have  a somewhat deeper or  perhapsthe  same  decline,  though shorter  in duration, and a much strongerrecovery.  DRI  is  one  example and  that\\'s  clearly their  forecast.  Onthe  inflation  side,  curiously  enough, the  Board staff\\'s  forecast  wouldbe  in  the  upper range  of  inflation rates  of  outside  forecasts  thatI\\'ve seen  for  1981.  In part  that\\'s  attributable  to  the fact  that manyof  the outside  forecasts  with a stronger recovery generate moreproductivity and  they\\'ve  incorporated a tax  cut  that  removes thesocial  security  [tax]  aspects.  But  I think the  conditionalassumptions here are  very different from  those being used by mostoutside  forecasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Well, we  think  it  will be  close  to  1 percentwithout  a constraint  on  the  time  horizon.  We  think it\\'s probablycloser  to  2/3  of  a percentage point  or  something  like  that  in  1981.Compensation  goes  up  by 3/4  of  a percent  because  of  that  effect and weassume it  will  be fairly  quickly passed through in  the  form of  higherprices.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.

Jim,  I was  a little  surprised  about  the  magnitudeof  the  announced increase  in  real  GNP  for  the  fourth  quarter.  Wherewould you guess  that will  end up  after  the  final  revisions  are  in?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  We don\\'t  have  any additional  information;  infact,  I\\'m not  sure  that  the  Commerce  Department has  anything in theway of  hard evidence right  now.  All  of  the  data  for  December areessentially missing,  including retail  sales.  The  obvious  assumptionwould have to  be  that  consumer expenditures  are even  stronger than wehave now  in  our  forecast.  [We  have]  a bit  higher  federal  expendituresthan  Commerce had,  a little  higher exports,  and our  inventories  were alittle  higher,  I believe.  So  the major  source  of  the difference  isconsumer  spending.  Our  information,  for  what it\\'s worth, wouldsuggest  to  us  that  real  consumer purchases  in December were  not  thatstrong.  We had built  into our  forecast  an  increase  of  about onepercent  in nominal  retail  sales  increases  in December,  excludingautos,  so  it\\'s virtually no  increase.  And  if  [Christmas]  turned  outto  be a strong  season,  that  2 or  2-1/2  percent  kind of  number  couldwell  come  out.  I would be  very  surprised  if  it were  3 percent  orhigher.  But  a 2 percent number  seems  to  me  to  be  perfectly plausibleat  this  point.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  2 percent  for what?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.

Jim,  first  a question:  I assume  that  theseprojections were glued  together before  the  President\\'s  grain embargostatement  was  issued and  therefore  do not  reflect  either  thesuspension of  additional  exports  to  Russia nor the promise by  thegovernment  for grain storage,  whatever that may mean.  Have you had achance  to  evaluate what  adjustment  there might  be  to  your  forecastbecause  of  these  twin  factors?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Yes,  we\\'ve  looked at  that.  There  are  a numberof  uncertainties  at  this point.  We don\\'t  think it  will have much ofan  impact on  real  GNP.  It  will  change  the  internal  mechanics  ofaccounting  for it,  namely  about  $2-1/2 billion  less  in  agriculturalexports.  And that  would show up  in  farm  inventories  or  government\\x0c1/8-9/80-57-purchases.  But,  in  fact,  for  real  GNP we don\\'t  think  it will  havemuch of  an  effect.  The  issue  really is  what price  effect it  mighthave  and whether over  the  longer run that  does  change  domestic  andforeign  exports  as well  as  domestic production.  And that\\'s  unclear.It  had seemed  to  us  that  it  might well  in  the  short run  lead to  higherprices;  but  I notice prices  seem to  be  falling,  so  we had that  onewrong.  It  seems  to us  that  the price  effect  is  more  important  and wedon\\'t  have  a good fix  on  that  right now.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Of  course,  there\\'s also  the  question of  whathappens  to  the  grain.  It  can\\'t be  stored indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  That\\'s  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  My other point  is  an  observation.  It  seems to  methat  one  of  the  factors making  consumers  spend much more  is  that,  forbetter  or  for worse,  they have had such an  increase  in  the  equity  intheir  homes  that  they consider  that  their  kitty.  That  could be verydangerous  if  there  is  a prolonged  slowing  in  [housing prices].  But  Iknow of  instances  involving personal  friends who  feel much moreprosperous and are  willing to  spend more  of  their  disposable incomejust  because they have a house  that they think has  gone  up  in value by50  percent  in  the  last  couple  of  years.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

Well,  don\\'t try  to get  me  to predict  thetiming of  some  of  these  things;  it  just  comes  in waves.  As  we said,the  product--whether  they\\'re buying  automobiles  or  refrigerators orwhatever the  composition  is--is  elusive here.

Following  along your question and GovernorWallich\\'s  comments,  I\\'d like  to  ask Jim a question and  then reservethe right  to  comment  on what  I think his  answer will be.  The  Chairmanforced you  into a policy recommendation  on fiscal  policy.  Would youindicate--you\\'ve got  to  have  some  idea  in mind since you gave  thatstatement--what  that would do  to your  own forecast?  Would you bewilling to  spell  that  out?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Well,  in terms  of  price behavior, we  haveperformed some  exercises with  our quarterly  econometric model  to  getsome notion of  the  impact  of  something  like  a mid-1980  tax  cut  in arange  of  about  $30  to  $35  billion.  We  think that by 1981  thatprobably would result  in a reduction  in  the  rate of  increase  in  thedeflator by about  3/4  of  a percentage point  from what  it  otherwisewould have been,  and  [a  larger decline]  over a longer  time horizon.At  the  same  time,  it  would have  small  impacts  on real  GNP;  we  thinkreal  GNP might be  up by  1/2  percentage  point  or  so.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  The  tax cut would  lead to  a reduction in  thedeflator?\\x0c1/8-9/80-58-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  That\\'s  because  it\\'s  oriented toward socialsecurity and business  fixed  investment  and not  toward  generatingadditional  direct  consumer expenditures.  So,  I gave you  an answerthat was  different than you  thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  But  in a way even better.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  President Willes,  that  tax package  isessentially  the difference between Strategy 3 and Strategy 4 on  page11  [of  the Bluebook].\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  That\\'s what  I thought.  Well, we\\'ve  been havinga lot  of  discussion about  tax  cuts  and  responding  to recession  and soon,  which is  a conversation that  is  similar  to  those we\\'ve been havingfor  the  last  10  years.  And the  only comment  I would make  is  that  wedo  that based on models  that have  proved  to  be off  track almost  everyyear for  the  last  10 years.  That  suggests  to  me  that  we havesomething misspecified.  Of  course,  some  of  us  think we  know what  thatis.  And I just  think now is  a time when we\\'re going  to  have  to  bevery cautious about what we  think we really  can do  to  try to have  animpact  in a systematic  way on real  variables.  I think we  all agreethat we  can have  an  impact  on  inflation;  but  it\\'s  not at  all  clear,based  on the  Fed\\'s model--or any other model--that we have  had torevise virtually every year because  it  went  off  track,  [that we  canhave  an impact  on real variables].  Our view is  that  the model  hasgone  off  track because  it\\'s misspecified;  and it\\'s  misspecified insuch  a way that  it  does not make  it  a reliable  tool  to  use  to  do  thesekinds  of  exercises.  I think we play  a very dangerous  game  if  we  thinkwe  can say with very much precision that we\\'re going to  have an  impacton these  real  variables  by  cutting  taxes  $30  billion or  $50  billion  orwhatever it  is  when the  best guess at  the moment, as  far  as  I cantell,  is  that  all  it  will  do  is  have  an  impact on  inflation and havepractically no impact  on unemployment  or  real  GNP or  any of  theseother  things  that we really would like  to  get  a handle  on.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  just  see  if  I understand whatyou\\'re  saying.  You\\'re  saying  that  a  tax  reduction of  any sort  willhave  an adverse  impact  on inflation and not  too much  impact  on thereal  economy, you  suspect.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  I think  at  the moment  that\\'s  the  best guess.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  There\\'s  no impact  on  real  activity throughgovernment policy?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  No,  I didn\\'t  say that.  Clearly  tax policy,monetary policy, and lots  of  things can have an  impact on realeconomic  activity.  But  as  far as  we  know it  can\\'t have  a predictableimpact.  We\\'re  going to  change  lots  of  things.  Any time  tax policychanges  it\\'s  going  to  change things.  It  changes  incentives,  itchanges  functions,  and  so on.  The  question  is:  Can we  predict  in afairly reliable way what  that  impact will  be?  And I don\\'t  seeanything  that  suggests  that we  can because  all  the  models  that  we  haveused  to  try  to make those predictions have proved to  be misspecified.And there\\'s  no  reason to  suppose  that  they  are any better specifiednow  than  they were  ten years ago.\\x0c1/8-9/80-59-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Are you simply  saying  that  the  variance aroundthe  forecast  is wider?  Or are  you  saying  that  the  forecast  is--?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  It\\'s not  a question  of  variance.  It\\'s  the  factthat  the parameters are  unstable and will  respond, in  our view ofcourse,  to  expectations.  Therefore, by  failing  to  factor expectationsin, we\\'ve  completely misspecified  the  shape  of  the  economy.  Ten yearsago  that would have  sounded like  an  absolutely  absurd assumption.  Ithink now the evidence  is  rather  considerably on  that  side.  I justwant  to  point out one  thing.  I think people  as  they\\'ve heard me  talkabout  it have said:  Well,  he  was  a monetarist  and  this  is  just  onemode  of monetarism.  The  theories  that we\\'re  talking about wereprimarily developed by Keynesians.  In  fact,  the  people around  ourplace who  have done  the most work  on it  originally came  to  us  to  workon optimal  control  theory and used  a model  like  the  Fed model todevelop optimal  control  techniques.  So,  it\\'s  not  as  if  it\\'s  just  themonetarists  who  think  they\\'ve found a new tool  to  play with.  I thinkit\\'s a very  serious  challenge  to  the bases we\\'ve been  looking  for  interms  of making  the  kinds  of  decisions--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SCHULTZ.  But don\\'t  you think,  even though one could viewthis  as  very imprecise  in  terms  of  the numbers  we come  out  with,  thatwe  can predict  the  direction?  Isn\\'t  that  really the more crucialquestion?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Well,  the best  guess  that we  can make,  if  we  tryto make adjustments--and one  can\\'t  do this  in  a very precise way, ofcourse, except  in  a very simple  model--is  that, yes,  we  can predictthe  direction  fairly precisely.  But  the  extent we  can predict whatwould happen  to  real  output  is  essentially  zero.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.

Let  me  just add  to Willis\\'  question.  Whatare you assuming about  special  government measures or  Home Loan Bankmeasures  or whatever?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  We  have built  into  the  forecast governmentsubsidized  [housing]  units  of  300,000, which  is  pretty much in  linewith what  the Administration talked about.  That\\'s  50,000 more  than inthe  last  fiscal year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  doesn\\'t mean,  then,  that  they  arecranking up  the  tandem plan?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE(?).  Well,  that\\'s part  of  it,  but  it\\'s not  amajor cranking up  of  the  tandem plan.  As you know, the budgetaryimpact  there  is  quite variable;  it  depends  on when the  governmentsells  those mortgages.  It\\'s  an  interest  [subsidy]  that  ultimatelyshows  up  in  the  federal  expenditures.  On the  authorizations,  that\\'s  adifficult  question because we  have built  in  a significant  increase  indefense  expenditures along the  lines  of  the  Administration\\'sproposals.  That  could well  go  higher.  A good deal  of  what  theAdministration is  proposing we  have assumed will  result  inauthorizations, but  not  expenditures,  particularly not  in  the  shortrun.  To  the  extent  that  the  defense  sector  is  geared up more  rapidly,there is  a bigger  increase  in actual  federal  outlays.  I think that\\'sconceivable, and  it  would obviously  feed into  the  real  side  forecast,particularly  in  1981.  So,  we\\'ve  assumed a good deal  of  lag betweenauthorizations and  expenditures.  I might  note that  defense  orderinghas  in  fact picked up  a good deal.  And in  the  fourth  quarter, one  ofthe  factors--not  the main  one--leading  to a significant  increase  infederal  outlays was a pickup  in  real  defense  expenditures.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

One  of  the  aspects  of  this  that  is  important,  too,is  the  extent to  which there  is  excess  capacity in  the  defense\\x0c1/8-9/80-61-industry  that  could take  up  a significant  increase  in defensespending.  We  learned  again  in  the Vietnam  conflict  that we  couldn\\'tspend as  fast  as  was  budgeted because  the  factory wasn\\'t  there;  theyhad to  tool  up  and so  forth.  It  takes  a much longer  time  to  acquire  asophisticated product.  But  that  is  one  of  the  considerations  thatperhaps--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WINN.  Related  to  that  is  the  fact  that  inventories  arerather  tight  and  [are  being  carefully]  watched  in most  of  thesespecial  sectors.  If  we get  any  change  in  that area, we\\'re going  tosee  explosive prices  and people  scrambling  for  the  short  supply.My  final  comment  is  that  I\\'m struck by the  number  of peoplewho  tell  me  they\\'re now pricing  for  inflation.  They  tell me  theytried a  price increase  in midyear  but  it  didn\\'t  go  because  theircompetitors  didn\\'t meet  it.  They  tried a price  increase  in Decemberand not  only did their  competitors meet  it  within  48  hours  but  they[moved]  ahead  of  them  in terms  of  the prices  themselves.  There  seemsto be  an  explosive development  related to  the  inventory  shortage  inthis  area.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  I\\'d  like  to  correct  the response  I gaveGovernor  Coldwell.  We  did not  assume  a  flat  6 percent  quarterly moneypath.  It\\'s  6 percent  QIV 1979  to  QIV  1980;  but  in  fact  we have  builtinto  our current  forecast  about  5-1/4  to  5-1/2  percent  growth in Ml  inthe  first  half  of  \\'80  and about  6-1/2  percent or  so  in the  secondhalf.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  But  you  didn\\'t do  any alternative  scenarios?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  No.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  there any  further  comments  on  thebusiness  situation?  If  not, we\\'ll  turn  to  the  decision we have  tomake.  Just by way of  background,  and summarizing yesterday\\'sdiscussion, I thought  there was  a  good deal  of  skepticism  expressedaround  the  table  about  the  idea  of  seeming  too precise much beyond1980.  I do  have  some  concern myself  about  the point  Mr.  Baughman madethat  it  may be  a little  hard to  escape  when  [we  are pressed  for]  somenotion of  what  we\\'re  going  to  do  after  1980.  But  the  advice  in  sumseemed  to  me  to  be  cautious  on  that  side.  There  seems  to  be  a prettystrong  consensus  that  a range  of  a  few percentage points  [for  thegrowth  of  the  aggregates]  is  about  right.  As  to possibilities  withinthat  kind  of  range,  I don\\'t want  to  prejudge where people  are  comingout  on  annual policy  itself.  There  was  a  fair  amount  of  [sentiment]for  [growth]  between 4-1/2  and 5 percent;  there were  some  for  a littleabove  5 up to  5-1/2  percent.  I think virtually everybody was  sayinggrowth probably  ought  to  be  lower  than what  it  was  last  year by somedefinition of  what it  was  last year.  So  I  think we  are  in  thatgeneral  area;  it  does  affect  what  we  do  in  the  short  range  to  someextent.  It may be graduated  in  our  individual minds  anyway.  Itshould be.  That  kind of  background  is  useful  to  our  short-rundiscussion.  Why don\\'t you  introduce  that  subject,  Mr. Axilrod.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In  turning to  this  matter, let  me  justmention a couple  of  things.  As  Mr. Roos  said yesterday, given  the new\\x0c1/8-9/80-62-technique we  are using and  all  the  complications of  an  annual  and  ashort-term horizon,  the Bluebook was  put  together  admirably  in myview.  It  does  take  a  quarter\\'s  time  horizon  for  this particularperspective was.  If  anybody has  any comment  on  that,  they  could offerit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.

In  Steve\\'s  comments  he raised  the  questionrepeatedly about whether the  Committee,  in effect, has  any preferenceas  to  how interest rates  evolve during this  period.  You can havedifferent points  of view on  that:  That  you  don\\'t care  or  that  it\\'s  avery  important question.  I would think comments  on  that  point arerelevant,  if  you think  they\\'re relevant.  The  only other point--I putthese points  down here earlier--is  that  I think  the most  certain  thingabout the  economic  forecast  is  that  during  this  particular 3-monthperiod we are very likely to  have  a higher consumer  price  index,  forall  that means  in  terms  of  expectations  and problems  of  various  sorts.So with  that,  we\\'ll proceed.  Mr. Roos.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman,  I am concerned  about what youalluded  to  as  a thread that ran  throughout  Steve\\'s comments  indicatinga continued concern about  interest  rates because  interest  ratemovements would affect  output  one way  or another.  It  seems  to  me--andI don\\'t  say  this  critically in your direction,  Steve--that we didadopt and publicly announce a new program whereby, within broadlimits,  we were  going  to permit  interest rates  to  fluctuate  freely inorder  to  concentrate  on  the control  and gradual  reduction  of  moneygrowth.  I think we will  frustrate  our whole purpose  and  thepossibility of  succeeding  in  this  new approach if  we have  tuckedbehind  in  our minds all  the  time  the view that  a primary, or at  leastvery  important,  aspect  of what  we\\'re  doing is  somehow  continuing alongthe path that we were  on  of  trying  to  control  interest  rates  and hopethat  in  this  process we  can achieve  some  [reduction  of]  money growth.I don\\'t  think we  can have  it  both ways.  I would ask Steve:  Is  thestaff  still  imbued with  a real  concern about  interest  rates?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  The  staff believes,  I think--and  I can\\'t  talkfor  everyone--that decisionmaking in  the  economy  is  affected by thelevel  of  interest  rates  and credit  availability.  On  the other hand,the  staff believes,  or at  least  I do,  that  it\\'s  difficult  for  theCommittee  to make  a priori  decisions  about  the proper  level  ofinterest  rates.  That\\'s why a money  supply target  is  important becausethen  those  decisions  come out  of  the market  to  a great  extent.However, because we believe  that  decisionmaking by businessmen  takesinto  account  credit costs  and availability,  it  seems  important  to  tryto  suggest what  the pattern  of  interest  rates might be  in the  courseof  the year, and that\\'s what  I was  trying  to  say.  If  the  Committeeadopted  a pattern  of money growth  in the  course  of  the year because  itwas  chasing a long-run target and got way ahead  of  it  early in  theyear and then wanted  to  catch up  for  credibility reasons  late  in  theyear,  that might  imply a very high  interest  rate.  You may not wantthat,  so you may want  to  give up  on your long-run target,  which couldbe  one  credibility problem.  If  we have very high  interest  rates,  Ibelieve  it would have  effects  on  economic activity in  1981.  If  weentered the year with  15  percent,  I think economic  activity in  1981would be  slower  than we\\'ve been projecting.  I\\'ve  asked Mr. Kichlinefor verification of  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  Let  me just  ask  this.  There has been referencemade to  the possibility that  interest  rates would drop.  I noted withinterest and with admiration  the  fact  that  the  Chairman in a recentspeech said publicly to  the world:  Don\\'t be  concerned if  interestrates drop because  under  our  new practices  interest  rates  could\\x0c1/8-9/80-64-conceivably  drop and not  signal  any easing  of policy.  Now,  isn\\'t  itpossible,  through  the  utterances  of the  Chairman and  others,  to  saythat we have  somewhat  of  a new ball game?  We\\'re doing  thisdifferently and people  should  stop  thinking  along the  lines  they havebeen accustomed to  thinking over  the  last  10  years because  the  last  10years certainly didn\\'t bring the  desired results.  I\\'m fearful  thatwe\\'re  just  letting  ourselves be  a little bit pregnant  and running allover the  lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  But,  President Roos,  to  be  very brief,  I wassimply addressing myself  to  the  question--raising  it  for  the Committee--of  whether you want  low growth of  M1  in  the  first  half  and highgrowth in  the  second half or  [vice  versa]  because  the  Committee has  tomake that  decision,  and there  are  certain  implications.  That\\'s what  Iwas  trying  to get  to.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  I may  say in  this  connection, Mr. Roos,I think we\\'ve got  a spectrum over which we can operate.  We used tooperate with very tiny  changes  in  federal  funds  rates  from time  totime,  or between meetings certainly, and not  very large  ones  even at  ameeting.  There is  no  doubt  that we have  changed;  in my opinion, theemphasis  is  quite  different now.  But  in  some people\\'s minds  it may bedifferent  than  in other people\\'s minds.  That  does not  excludenecessarily some  predilection about which way to  bias  this  in  theshort  run.  People may have  some druthers  one way or  another withoutat  all  implying  that  we\\'re controlling  the  federal  funds  rate the waywe did before.  But  one might want  to  lean  in one  direction oranother.  Maybe other people wouldn\\'t want  to lean  in  one  direction oranother.  But we  don\\'t have  to make  it  a choice between dismissingfrom  the minds of  everybody around  this  table  any  concern aboutinterest  rates and going back  to  what we were doing  before, which wasa very  close  focus  on  the  federal  funds  rate within  a quarterpercentage  point.  It\\'s  just  that  we\\'ve got  to make  some  decision.The decision  is made  in  terms  of  the  money supply, but  that  decisionat  any particular meeting may be biased  in some people\\'s minds by  someguess,  anyway, as  to  where they  would prefer  the  interest  rate musicto  accompany  it--the  treble  to  accompany the  base  or whatever  that[expression]  is.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  You don\\'t  have  to  recant  in  the presence  of--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  If  I may follow up on  this.  The purpose  of  amoney  supply target presumably  is  to  force  wider swings  in  interestrates.  If  we stick  to  the  same rate  of  money growth through expansionand recession, we\\'ll  get very wide  swings  of  rates, wider  than we\\'vebeen willing  to  impose  by acting a priori,  as  Steve  said, on theinterest  rate.  But  to me  that  doesn\\'t mean that  it  is  logical  to moveto  severely negative  real  interest  rates because  we have  a recession.There are  considerations of  having  a positive or  a negative realinterest  rate,  and  to my view  the ability  to  swing widely toward  a lowinterest rate  is  limited by that.  It  should not become  severelynegative.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Perhaps we  could combine  comments on  thisconceptual  and  theoretical point with practical  comments on where weshould put  the money  supply target  in  the next month.  Mr. Eastburn.\\x0c1/8-9/80-65-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  Well,  I would like  to respond  to  Steve\\'scomments  about the  path  of money growth.  I think where we  go  on  thisdepends  on how smart we  are.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You\\'re not  assuming too much on  that?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  My conclusion  from  listening to  the  discussionbefore is  that we\\'re  really not all  that  smart  as  to be  able  to  dothat.  And  that  forces me  into  the position that  if  we have  as  a long-range  strategy a gradual  reduction of money growth, we ought  to  figureout  where we want  to  start  and pretty well  stick to  that.  That  putsme,  since  I came  out yesterday  at about  5 percent  for  1980,  withalternative  B.  I don\\'t mean hold to  that  inflexibly if  unexpectedthings  develop, but  I just  don\\'t  think we\\'re able  to  do  the  kind  offine-tuning  that  is  suggested by the Bluebook in  terms  of  frontloading  or rear  end loading or  whatever.  I\\'d just put  down  5 percentand  stick  to  it  until  we  decide we  have  to  make some  kind of  a change.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Coldwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Well,  Mr. Chairman,  it  seems  to me  that  thedirection we\\'re working on here  is  to  lower the  [growth  in  the]monetary aggregates.  I would accept  alternative  C, for  which you havegrowth of  4 percent.  I\\'d be  willing to  accept a range  around that,although  I\\'m not  sure  how this  is  all  working out with  single pointsversus  ranges  in  the  short run.  But  I\\'d be perfectly willing  toaccept,  say, 3-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent  or  something  like  that.  Mypresent predilection would be  to  accept  a lower  level  in the  firsthalf and  see what  the  second half  brings.  Because my primaryobjective  is  to  try  to get  some  impact  on  the price  level,  I\\'m notsure  that  I totally agree--in  fact,  I\\'m fairly sure  I don\\'t  agree--with what  the  staff  is  saying, which is  that we  can\\'t  have  some impacton prices  here.  I doubt very much if  this  long-range  low growthsaucer  forecast is  really a reasonable one  over a long period of  time;things  will  change.  A recession  is  likely in  the next year;  it\\'stiming  is  uncertain.  And I\\'m reasonably  sure  that  something will comeup and destroy that  lovely little package  over  the next  8 quarters.The complex  of political  as  well  as  economic  and  foreign factors  issuch  that  I would opt  for  a lower  level  in  the  range, particularlysince  we  got  something  in  the  3-1/2  to  4 percent  area  in  the  fourthquarter, as  I recall,  Steve, rather  than  the  4-1/2  percent we were[expecting].\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  We  got  3 percent  from September  to  December and4.9 percent,  I think,  for  the  quarterly average.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just  for  purposes of  clarification,Governor Coldwell, when you began  talking about  a range,  is  thatmerely a reflection of  our  frailties  in achieving  the number or  do youhave  something  in your mind about  interest  rates,  let\\'s  say?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Well,  I was  coming to  that,  Mr. Chairman.  Therange  I put down was partly because  of  our  frailties  in  achieving anumber, and  I\\'d give  the Desk  a little guidance  rather than  just  leaveit  to  the  Manager  to make  some  ad hoc  decisions  on  it.  But it  alsoreflects  some  interest  in the  interest  rate package.  Contrary to  Mr.\\x0c1/8-9/80-66-Roos,  I think  interest  rates  are  an  important  element  of  the  impactboth on  expectations and on  consumer and  capital  expenditures.  So,I\\'m unwilling  just  to  wash my hands  of  interest  rates  and say  \"Gowhere you want  to  go.\"  I don\\'t  think  it\\'s  likely  [to  have no  impact]internally, and  I think  it\\'s  even  less  likely to  have no  impactexternally  in our  relationships with other  countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Black.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  As  I indicated yesterday, Mr. Chairman, mypreference on the  long-run  targets would be  to  go mainly with M-1B.It  increased at  a 7.3  percent rate  last year and  I think 6 percent  isa reasonable rate  for  [this  year].  If  the  relationships  set  forthover  the  next year  between  the  old M1 and M-1B hold  in the  future,this would suggest  that  the  appropriate  long-run range  for M1  would beabout  5-1/2  percent.  Against  this background, I think we  ought  to  beworking down  our  target  growth rates  and I would favor alternative  B.Now, that  does  specify rates  that  are below what  I\\'ve  indicated  Ithought was  probable for M1  and M-1B, but  I would be  prepared tosupport  that  for three  reasons.  One  is  that  I think we  still  have  avery serious  credibility  gap.  I find few people  in  the  financialwe  announced October  6th.  So,  I think we need  some  low growth  ratesvery quickly in order  to  better  establish our credibility.  The secondreason why  I would  favor being  somewhat  lower in  the beginning  is  thepoint  that  Frank Morris made yesterday:  This  seems  to be  about  theonly  time we  can  get  the growth  rates  down.  That  may be  in partbecause  the  market  used to  determine  to  a greater  degree how muchmoney it  got  than  it presumably will  under  this new system, butthere\\'s  still  an  element  of  that  in  there.  And  then, third, pastexperience has  shown  that we usually  get  bursts  in  the  aggregates  inthe  second and third quarters.  While  that  may have  stemmed from badseasonal  adjustments  or  the  old methodology, I\\'m still  suspicious  thatit might  happen  [again];  so  I would like  to  get  some pretty  lowfigures under  our belt before  it  does  happen, if  in  fact  it  does.  Sofar  as  the  range  for  federal  funds  is  concerned, philosophically  I\\'dlike very wide  ranges  and would be  tempted  on purely philosophicalgrounds  to widen  that  range,  particularly at  the  low end.  But  this  isnot  a time  to  stand on pure philosophical preferences  because  it\\'sundoubtedly  true  that  foreigners  and people  in  this market,  too,  arepaying a great  deal  of  attention  to  what  interest  rates  are doing.So,  I think  it\\'s  important  that we  not let  the  rate  go below 11-1/2percent,  and  I would put  that  as  a floor until  such  time  as  we havebetter credibility  than  I think we  now have.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Partee.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  I\\'m pretty  sympathetic with  Dave Eastburn\\'scomments.  I think  fine-tuning  is  difficult  in practice, and  I wouldpoint  out  that  the main misses  that we\\'ve had have been large misses.That  is,  it  really  isn\\'t  that we  expect  5 percent  and get  4 percent.We expect  5 percent  in a month and get  zero  or  a minus;  or we  expect  5percent and  get  10.  That has  been  the  nature  of  the chunkiness  ofthat  demand  function for  money, and I think that  demand  function isthere  just as  it  always was.  The  question now is:  What  kind ofresponse will  a sudden change  in  the  growth rate  of money bring  interms  of policy?  I guess  I would  say that  under  our new procedures  itwould bring a very abrupt  and considerable change  in  interest  rates,\\x0c1/8-9/80-67-either up  or  down.  So,  without  fine-tuning  I rather  like  the  5percent  on  the old definition.  I guess we\\'re talking about  currentdefinitions,  aren\\'t  we?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  We  would specify it  in  current  terms.  I likethe  5 percent  of  alternative B, partly because that would give us4-1/2  percent  for  the  quarter which,  if  we get  it,  will be  on  themoderate  side  from the  standpoint of  the  ranges  that we  choose  for  theyear.  I would be willing  to  tolerate  a little  shortfall  from  that  5percent, say,  to  4 percent.  But  if  it  comes  in  significantly weakerthan that,  I think we would want  to be  supplying the reserves  and wewould want  to  be  seeing  interest  rates move.  There  is  something towhat  Larry says,  although he  perhaps overstated  it  a little,  that wehave  to  be  prepared to  see  interest  rates move  in  response to  a need.I would  like  to  see  us  take the  alternative A specifications  of  7-1/2and 8 percent  for M2  and M3  rather than  those  in alternative  B.  Wedon\\'t  really  know what  success  that new  [floating  rate]  certificate  isgoing to have.  It\\'s  being  advertised very strongly by the  thriftinstitutions  and  I wouldn\\'t  want  to  see  us tighten up because  ithappened that  the thrift  institutions  had a good  inflow from  thepromotion of  the 2-1/2  year  certificate.  [On  the  funds rate,]  I thinkwe\\'re  a long  way from either  11-1/2  or  15-1/2 percent  and  I don\\'t  seehow we  could get  to  11-1/2  percent without  taking action on  thediscount  rate.  So  I would  leave  that  range  right where  it  is  at11-1/2  to  15-1/2  percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Kimbrel.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman,  I continue to  be  concerned aboutthe  expectations  and realities of  our price level  and  about  thepossibility of  the influence  we can have  on our  exchange  ratefrailties  at  the moment.  I\\'d be  very anxious  to  reaffirm our posture,a posture  that would indicate  a continuing steady move  to  a generalreduction  of  the  growth rate  [of money].  I recognize  that  this mightvery well contribute  to  interest rate  changes, but  [with]  some moreflexibility.  But  in  the  real world we  simply have to  be  a littleattentive to  the level  of  [unintelligible].  I think we  cannot movequite  that abruptly.  All  of  that  leads  me to  feel  that  I\\'d be  rathercomfortable with the numbers  associated with alternative  C.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Mayo.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Mr.  Chairman,  I want  to  make a couple  of  points.First  of  all,  I want  to  agree with Dave Eastburn\\'s  philosophy of  notmonkeying around with fine-tuning  among the quarters.  This  makes usthink we are  smarter  than we are,  among  other things,  to  use hislanguage.  The purpose here  is  to  set  a long-term range  and, unless wesee  some  rather  dramatic  reason for  changing  it,  to make  our quarterly[objectives]  basically  consistent with that,  subject  to  some  smallvariations--and  I mean  small--that  Steve may feel  he has  to  introduceinto  the staff  projection.  I feel  also,  although we have made  a giantstep  forward  in moving  [from 2-month  horizons]  to  September-to-make one more  refinement  of  that  in  the  interest  of  not  being toooverwhelmed by monthly changes  [in  the growth of  money].  It would bemuch better if  for  the  current  quarter, or  the decision which  is  being\\x0c1/8-9/80-68-made  today,  on  January 9, to  use  the month of  January as  our centermonth and  in  effect  take  the  fourth quarter  of  1979  and go  to  thequarter  centered on  the  current  date.  That means  comparing  theaverage  for  the  fourth quarter with the  average  for  December,  January,words,  it would be  literally  fourth quarter-to-first quarter.  I thinkthat makes  a lot more  sense and gets  us  over  part of  our hangup wherewe spend,  it  seems  on occasion,  an  interminable  amount  of  time  tryingto  explore  the  seasonal adjustment  deficiencies  of  a given month.Granted that  going  to  three months  is  in  the  right  direction, I wouldurge  strongly that  the  Committee  consider going  from quarter  toquarter.  It may look awkward because  in the  first  instance in  effectwe  have  to have December at  both ends  of  our  equation.  But  as  we moveon out,  of  course,  that  overlap would not occur.  It\\'s  just  a neaterproposition  and would help  in  the  smoothing of  this.  Again,  the pointis--and  I think Dave made  it  effectively--that  we  can do  a better  jobthat way.I would add that  I prefer alternative B partly because  I likethe  3 to  6 percent  long  range and  the  3 to  6 percent  short  range,which yields  a midpoint--whether by coincidence or  not--of  4-1/2percent  for  the quarter-to-quarter  change.  I guess  that  is  for  thefourth  quarter  to  the  first quarter  literally, Steve.  I don\\'t  knowwhat  it  would be  for  December, January, February;  maybe  it  doesn\\'tmake much difference.  I feel  very strongly that the  answer  to  thequestion of  \"Do we pay attention to  interest  rates?\"  is  that,  ofcourse, we pay attention to  interest  rates.  We pay  attention tointerest rates  just  like we pay attention to  real  GNP, unemployment,and an awful  lot  of  factors.  In my mind we  shifted  in  the  October  6thpackage  from a primary public  emphasis  on  interest  rates to  a primarypublic  emphasis  on the  aggregates,  with the  targets going  throughreserves.  We  have not  abandoned all  of  our  secondary emphases.  Weemphasize plenty of  things,  one  of which has  to be  interest  ratesbecause we  live  in  the  real  world and  the execution  of  monetary policymust be  through  a market  that pays  attention to  interest rates.There\\'s no  substitute  for  that;  at  least  I\\'ve  never heard of  one  inour  type  of  society.One  other  point:  I think the  Federal  Reserve  System would bemaking a serious mistake  to publish M-1A and M-1B  and M2  and M3  and Land  say to  the world, in  effect:  We  don\\'t know which of  these  isright;  take your choice.  Now, I\\'m perhaps  overstating.  I would pickM-1B myself  and call  it Ml,  drop the  B.  And if  we have to  qualify thedescription  of  it  because  of  NOW accounts or  other  changes, we  shouldqualify  it.  But we  are being almost  too  research oriented, too muchstudents  of  this  rather  than decisive leaders.  If  we  can\\'t  determinewhich one we  think  is better,  with some  qualifications and  so  forth,nobody can.  And I think our  leadership  role depends  in  large part onour ability  to  go  through  this whole  redefinition of  the aggregatesand to  avoid coming  out with  a definition that  looks  like  the mousehas really  squeaked by coming up with M-1A.  I would recommendstrongly that  we publicize M-lB as  Ml.  We  can handle  theconsequences.  End  of  speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Baughman.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman,  it  seems  to me  that  the targetsset  out  in  alternative C have a good probability of  coming pretty\\x0c1/8-9/80-69-close  to serving  the  needs  of  the  environment  as  they unfold in  thenext  couple  of  months  or  so.  I\\'ve been  rather  impressed with theobservation  through  time  and in  conversations here  that we can\\'t havemuch influence  on how the  expansion  in  money and credit  is  allocatedbetween production and  prices.  The  indication  is  that  the  structureof  the economy  and expectations  are  tending  to  allocate  it  more andmore  to  prices  and less  and  less  to  production, which leaves  us  in  anawkward  situation of  simply embracing  or  accepting  it  or  seekinggreater  slack in  the  economy--and probably for  a fairly long period  oftime--in order  to make  some increased  impact  on  the  inflation  problem.But  it  seems  to me  that  the  inflation problem must be  given priorityin  part because  the  darn  thing  just  keeps  getting worse  and worse.I\\'d be prepared to  accept pretty much whatever  interest rate  patternevolved during  the  appropriate  time period as  a result  of pursuingthese  quantitative  targets.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mrs.  Teeters.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS. TEETERS.  Well,  I want  to  ask  a question  first.  Youreconomic forecast  is based on  a 6 percent  rate  of  [money]  growth.  Ifyou  take the  rate  of  growth  of  money down another  full percentagepoint, what  does  that  do to  real growth  and to  the unemployment rate?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You did assume  that  the  rate  of  growth  inmoney would be  slower in  the  first half  of  the  year?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Yes.  The  staff  forecast  is  based upon  themoney path of  alternative  1 on page  15  in  the  Bluebook, which is  6percent  for  the  year.  It\\'s  slower  in  the  first  half--I  think it\\'saround  5-1/2 percent  and  then  6-1/2  percent  in  the  second half--butthe  short-run path  consistent with  that  is  alternative  B.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  What  happens  if  you reduce  that path by a fullpercentage point?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KICHLINE.  Do you  mean for  the  long-run target  or  theshort-run target?  In  the  short  run,  if you  stuck  to  the  6 percenttarget mentioned and simply altered  the money path for  one quarter  andthen picked  it  up  the next  quarter,  it  really wouldn\\'t have  asignificant  impact on  inflation  or  real  GNP.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Governor Teeters,  there\\'s a degree  of  fine-tuning in  the  numbers here  that has  to  be  taken with a grain of  salt.But  on page  25  in appendix C,  if  you reduce  that  5 percent  to  4percent  and still  aim at  something  like  6 percent M1  growth, which  iswhat Jim\\'s  assumption  is--that\\'s  the  third column under alternative  C--you\\'d end up  in the  fourth quarter with a somewhat  lower  funds  ratethan under his basic  assumption to  make up  for  the  greater  restraintnow.  That\\'s  in  essence what  that would tend  to  lead  to.  Similarly,if  you had a 5-1/2  percent  long-run growth, which we have  not  shownhere,  the  funds  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter would probably be  somewhatlower under a short-run alternative  C path  than under  short-runalternative B path.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS. TEETERS.  I\\'m not  sure  I got  a  [complete]  answer.  Myinclination is  that  if  we  cut  [money  growth]  below the  6 percentthat\\'s  in  the  forecast  for  the year, we\\'ll  have  a more  severerecession on  our hands as  we keep  the  interest rates  up.  I have  a\\x0c1/8-9/80-70-great  deal  of  sympathy with Dave  Eastburn\\'s  point  of  view that  weshould  stick to  a number and  let  the  interest  rates  fluctuate.  WhereI come  out  is  that  I\\'d  like  to  see  a 5-1/2 percent  growth  rate  for  theyear  as  a whole and  I\\'d set  a target  of  approximately  5 percent  forthe  quarter  to  give us  a little  range to meet  the  needs  at  the  end  ofthe  year.  I don\\'t  think,  frankly,  that we  can undertake  a policy  for3 years  of  consistently reducing  the rate  of  growth  of money supply.I just  don\\'t  think  that\\'s  in  the  cards  for us  in  terms  of what\\'s goingto happen  in  the  economy.  We\\'ve  brought  the  rate  of  growth downconsistently now for  3 years, but  there\\'s a certain minimum to  whichwe  can  get and I don\\'t think  it\\'s  3 or  4 percent.  We  are  going to  getourselves  into  a position of  setting a target which  is  so much  too  lowthat  it\\'s  either going to  have  severe  impacts  on  the  real  growth ofthe  economy or we\\'re not  going  to meet  our  targets.  Realistically,we\\'re  going to  [have  to]  come  down  to  a plateau  for  growth of  themoney supply and  try to hold it  there  rather  than  reduce  it  apercentage point year after  year;  and a rate  of  growth  in  the moneysupply  of  about  5-1/2  percent strikes me  as  about where  that minimumis,  given the  other  things  that are  going on  in  the  economy.  So,  Ican buy alternative B for  the  quarter, but  I do have  a higher targetfor  the year  as  a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Timlen.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. TIMLEN.  My preference,  Mr. Chairman, is  for alternativeC.  I think  it\\'s  consistent with efforts  to  reduce  the growth  in  theaggregates over  the year 1980  and also  consistent with  the  [view]  thatthe basic  economy may be  slowing  in  the  first quarter.  I think itwould have  an  important  impact  on  inflationary  expectations and helpour  credibility.  It will  also  [add]  strongly to  the message  conveyedin  terms  of  the  relevant  interest  rates  in  the  foreign  exchangeopposed to  the  movements  against reserve  targets.  I don\\'t have  astrong  feeling  on what  the  federal  funds  range  should be, whether  itshould be  11-1/2  to  16  percent  or  11-1/2  to  15-1/2  percent.

If  I rely  on  the money  supply,  it\\'s  becausein  [a  period of]  inflation  I think  that\\'s a better way to get  theright  interest  rates  than  to  try to  do  it  outright.  But  I don\\'tregard  the money  supply as  a black box where I have  to  accepteverything  that  comes out.  So  if an unreasonable  interest rate  comesout,  I reserve  the  [option]  to  evaluate that  on its  own terms.  AsNancy said, we have reduced the  growth of  the money supply for  3 yearsrunning and have brought  inflation  from about  7 percent  to  13  percentin doing  so.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

Well,  we  can argue  about the  numbers,  but[inflation]  has  gone up while  the  growth of  the money supply as  wedefine  it  has  gone  down.  So  I  lean toward  the  tighter  side  for  thelong term, alternative  II.  And within  that  framework  I  lean towardalternative  C in  terms of  the  old definitions  of money.  I don\\'t  carewhether we  use the  old or  the  new definitions,  just  so  we  don\\'tmisunderstand.  I would  go with  the numbers  that  are  in  the Bluebookunder  alternative C:  4 percent  for M1;  6.5  percent  for M2;  and 7percent  for M3.  I would raise  the lower  end  of  the  funds  rate  from11-1/2  to  12  percent  and make  the  top  16  percent.  I agree with Chuckthat  before  the rate  got  to  11-1/2  percent  we would probably  findourselves making a decision  about  the discount  rate  anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.

Mr.  Chairman,  I think alternative  B  looks  good,even  though I came  out  yesterday  for a  4-1/2 percent midpoint.  I feelthat  if we  are  going to  bias  the  flow during the year, it  ought to  bethe  opposite of  what most people  have been saying.  I think the  rateof  growth in  the  early part of  the  year ought  to be  greater and therate  of  growth in  the  latter part  of  the  year  less  because  I think wewill  be better off  with a saucer-shaped recession  than a V-shaped one.So,  to  the  extent  that we  can obtain  these  [rates  of growth],  it\\'ssuch a weak economy that  it  should help  to  cushion the  extent  of  therecession.\\x0c1/8-9/80-72-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You hope  to  produce a more  saucer-shapedthan V-shaped one  [and  would]  increase  the money  supply more rapidlyin  the  first part  of  the year  and less  rapidly in  the  second part.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  Right.  Traditionally,  following our  earlierpolicies, we have  supplied very  little monetary growth  in  the earlypart  of  a recession.  We  have  encouraged  a sharper  decline  in theeconomy thereby.  We  lagged  in reducing  interest  rates  and then whenthe  unemployment rate got  really high, we  turned around  and producedvery rapid rates  of  growth in  the money supply.  That  led to  very bigswings  in  the  economy, which I think  are  counterproductive  in the  longrun to  controlling  inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. RICE.  May I interrupt, sir?  Don\\'t  you think  the  shapeor  the  depth of  the recession  is  already determined now?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  It probably is,  largely.

Mr.  Chairman, given  the  forecast  for nominal  GNPfor  this  quarter which  I believe  is  5 percent  and  is,  of  course, veryweak, and given the  forecast  for  the  inflation rate which  I understandis  15  percent  for  this  quarter,  I would--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  consumer price  index.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. RICE.  The  consumer price  index, yes.  I think  this  is  agood quarter to  try to  keep  the  rate  of  growth  in money at  the  low endof  the  1980 range.  That would give  us  leeway to  allow it  to expand  ata faster rate  later  on in  the year if  that  appears  desirable,  and Ithink it  will appear desirable.  So  for  this  quarter  I would favoralternative C;  I would be  comfortable with a 4 percent  rate of  growthfor  the next  3 months.  Also,  I think this  is  not  the  time  to  accept asharp reduction  in  interest  rates, and  alternative C will  assure thatinterest  rates  will not  fall  significantly.  So my preference at  thistime would be  for  alternative  C.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Balles.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman,  as  a number of  people  around  thetable have  already noted,  1979  was  a nonrecession year.  It\\'s  a bit  of\\x0c1/8-9/80-73-a humbling  experience  in  terms  of  our  ability not  only  to  fine-tunebut  to  forecast.  As  I recall  your  statements  on the  subject,  I  thinkit\\'s  to  your  credit  that  you  spoke  out  and  said  that  you weren\\'t  surewe were  in  a  recession despite  announcements  coming  from  other highplaces  that  the  recession began a couple  of  months ago  and was  alreadyhalf over.  That\\'s  an  interesting commentary on  the  state  of  the  artof  forecasting.  In any event,  given  that uncertainty  about  ourability not  only  to  fine-tune but  to  forecast,  it  seems  to me  thatinflation  does  remain  the  key  threat  to  the  longer-term health of  theeconomy--to  economic growth,  employment  growth, a  sound dollar, and  soon.  For all  those reasons  and without  going  into  any more  detail,  I,too,  would  come out  at  this  time  in  favor of  alternative C.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. GUFFEY.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  I,  too,  would  opt  foralternative  C,  taking  advantage of  what would appear to be  fairly  slowgrowth  in money that we  are  focusing on  in  the  first  quarter.  I wouldnote  that  historically--in recent  history at  least--we haven\\'t  hadvery much growth  in money  in  the  first  quarter  and, quite  likely,  thathistory will  be  duplicated  this year.  To get  somewhat  of  a head starton our  longer-run  targets  it  seems  to me  that  we  ought  to  accept  thatslow growth  in  the  first  quarter;  and  as  a result  alternative  C wouldbe  attractive.  I would also  note that  if you  focus  on Ml,  its  growtheven under  alternative C is  greater  in  the first  quarter  than we  hadin  the  fourth quarter, which turned out  to be  a  fairly strong quarter.I don\\'t  know what  that  implies  except  that  it  just  reinforces  mythought  that  we quite  likely will get very slow growth  in  the  firstquarter and  ought  to  tolerate  it  whether  it  is  below 4 percent  or not.The  interest  rates  are  an  important  factor both domestically andinternationally and we  shouldn\\'t  lose  sight  of  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

It  wouldworry me  if  we  had a sharp drop  in  interest  rates  in  this  quarter whenwe  show very high inflation rates.

Gentlemen,  ladies.  After great Solomonicperusal  of  the preferences  expressed  by the members  of  the Committeeand others,  and  evaluation of  those qualitative  comments  that weremade--the  acute  ones  and  I discarded  the  others--let me  make a generalcomment.  I think,  as  a number of  people  have mentioned, that we  havean  image problem  or  an  opportunity--I  don\\'t know which  to  call  it--that  is  perhaps  as  important  as  the numerology at  the moment.  I havesympathy for  the  comments  that  said we have  to  appear to  be quitecautious during  this period, particularly until  the market  gets  alittle more  settled down  in  terms  of  interpreting our actions.Substantively, I personally would not mind seeing  some  decline  ininterest  rates;  in  fact,  I think  it would be  desirable  on  the domesticside  if  we can get  by with it  on  the  international  side.  It may be alittle inconsistent with  the energy problem, and  this  is  where thecompromise has  to be  struck.  Everybody was  between  \"B\" and  \"C\" in  oneway or  the  other basically.  There  are probably a few more on  theCommittee  for  \"C\",  but  [the  margin]  is  very narrow, and  for  the  non-voting members  it  is  a bit  the other way.Nobody talked much about  the  interest  rate  range.  I wouldsay,  consistent with  the  desire not  to  have  a misinterpretation of  ouractions,  since  there  is  not very strong  reason  to  change  the  interestrate  parameters  anyway,  let\\'s  just  leave  the range  the  same.  In  thatrespect  we  can  say when  this  [directive]  is  published  that  there  canbe no misunderstanding  about whether  any  change was made with regardto  the  interest  rate parameters.  I\\'m not  sure  that  the  bottom or  topof  any of  the  [proposed]  ranges  is  going  to  be  relevant during  thisperiod, as  a number of  people have  indicated, so  I don\\'t  think  thereis  a strong reason to  change the  range.  I would propose  leaving  it  asis.  It  was  also  implicit  in  the  comments  that primary, but notexclusive,  emphasis  is  to be  placed  on M1.  That  is  the measurebasically used  to  construct  the  paths;  we don\\'t  ignore  [M2],  but  it\\'snot  exactly a 50-50  weighting proposition.  I\\'m not  going to  suggestwhat  weight  it  has in  any numerical  terms.  I think the  primaryemphasis  will  tend to  be  on M1,  but we will keep a weather  eye  cockedon the  M2  figure.In  terms  of  the  range  [for  Ml],  as  I said, everybody was  [forgrowth]  between 4 and 5 percent,  and I would propose  that we  juststate  it  in  the  directive  as  \"between 4 and  5 percent,\"  which I thinkis  consistent  with the  atmospherics  of  the  [situation].  That  is  opento an  interpretation that  I personally would not  resist,  but we would\\x0c1/8-9/80-75-draw a path  on  the  basis  of  4-1/2  percent  consistent with  that  openingstance.  But  let me  say  that we  would be  more concerned about asituation where  [growth]  was  tending  toward  the  lower  side,  4 percentor  below--we  can\\'t  control  these  things  that  closely--and  interestrates were  rising;  we would  tend  to  get  aggressive more  quickly,providing  more reserves.  And  if  it  went  in  the other  direction whereit  was drifting high,  if  interest  rates were  falling  out  of  bed  andgiving us  trouble on  the  international  side  we would be prompter  aboutgetting  it  back in  the  range,  in  terms  of  attitudes  and judgmentsabout  the  kind of  path  shifts that  we have  to make  in  the reservenumbers  in  the period.  But we  would start  out with 4-1/2  percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  COLDWELL.  I\\'m not  quite  sure  you  said what  you wanted  to\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I may have  said  it  wrong, but  Isay.think you--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  You mean we  should react more  rapidly  if  M1growth goes  up with the  interest rates  falling  than  if  M1  growth wentdown  and  interest  rates were rising.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  either way.  In  other  words,  if M1[growth]  were  low and interest  rates were  also  low, we would be  slowabout  changing.  But  if  it were  low  and interest  rates were high, wewould  change more quickly.  It\\'s  how quickly we  move  to  make thejudgment, which might have  to  be made.  It\\'s  just  this  judgmentalissue, which we went through  at  least  once,  of  changing  the path  inthe  view of  what  is  happening.Well,  Mr. Altmann  just  wrote  [suggested wording  for]  thedirective which says  \"between 4 and  5 percent  for M1  and  on  the  orderof  7 percent  for M2.\"  The  latter  happens  to  be  the  alternative  Bnumber.  It\\'s  another  way of  saying  something around  7 percent.  Sothat\\'s what  I would propose  for your  consideration.  Operationally,the  question arises  as  to  what  that  means  in  technically constructinga path.  I suggest  that  it  means  4-1/2  percent  for  the  arithmetic  ofit,  but we  have  to  make  this  borrowing assumption  in constructing thepath.  That  seemed  to  be an  easier  decision before  last  week thanafter this  week.  This week has been somewhat  of  an  aberration, wherewe had a high funds  rate  consistent with an  exceptionally low--inexplicably  low--borrowing level.  All  I can say--and  I think we  haveto  be prepared  to  look  at  it  again  after another week or  two  ofevidence to  see  if  this  aberration  seems  to  be  continuing or  if  itseems  to  be  reverting  to  the  earlier pattern--is  that  I have  a niceround number  to  suggest  to you;  that  it  is  a round number may be  itsonly virtue.  But  it  falls  between  the  earlier  experience  and thepresent  experience, and  the number  is  $1 billion  of borrowing.  Now,that  is  lower than  anything we have been dealing with up until  thispast week.  The  latest  information on  the  money supply,  as  nearly  as  Ican  gather--I  hate  even  to  put  this  in your mind  in  a way, but  havingopened the  issue  I will  put  it  in your mind--is  that  the  tea  leaves  wehave on  the number  for  next week\\'s  publication would  show fairlysignificant  growth.  It\\'s  not  inconsistent with this  4  to  5 percentrange but,  if  anything,  it  is  a bit  toward  the  upper  side  of  thatrange  for January.\\x0c1/8-9/80-76-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  A  stronger number, Mr.  Chairman, is  for  [theweek]  we  are  not  [yet]  going  to  publish.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It\\'s  not  the  number we  are going  topublish this week but  the number we would publish  next week.  It\\'s  avery unreliable  indication, but  for  what  it\\'s worth,  it  is  notinconsistent  with this kind  of  range.  But  it  doesn\\'t  suggest  thatthere  is  great  danger  of  [Ml]  falling way down  in  the range  in\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  We would be  projecting a  5 percent  rate  ofgrowth  in  January instead of  3-1/2  percent,  if  that  number held up.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So  the  proposal  is  for:  11-1/2  to  15-1/2percent,  or  unchanged  on  interest  rates;  between 4  and 5 percent  on M1with the  understanding  that  I  suggested about  7 percent  in M2;  andstarting  out--but  looking at  that very hard in  a week  or  two  in  thelight  of  this  recent aberration--with something  like  $1 billion  ofborrowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  One  cosmetic  thing.  Would  it  be  better to  say\"about\"  4 to  5 instead of  \"between\" 4 and  5?  It  sounds very specific,as  if  we  expect it  to  come  between  the numbers.  I realize  that\\'s  whatwe mean, but we won\\'t  accomplish  it.  So  maybe  if we  said  \"about\"  4  to5 percent--.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I have  the  slight  feeling  that maybe  \"between\" is  alittle better  cosmetically, but  it\\'s  no big deal.  Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Well,  I have  a couple of  points  of  uneasiness.One,  it  seems  to  me  that  we may be  biasing  this  in  the  direction oflower  interest rates  by the  low borrowing assumption.  What  happens  ifborrowing  is  higher?  Then, presumably,  until  the nonborrowed reservepath is  adjusted, total  reserves  would be higher  than we  thought.  Sothe  low borrowing assumption does  have  some  implication  for  the  totalreserves we  anticipate and  for  interest  rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I\\'m not  quite  sure  that\\'s  right,  Henry.We are  getting into  this darn  lagged reserve accounting  again.  But  inthe  immediate  future, which  is  going  to  be  relevant  for  judging  this,we will  know what the  level  of  reserves  is.  We  are  just  judging  thenonborrowed reserve path, saying we are putting the nonborrowedreserve path at  $1 billion below what we  know reserves will be  nextweek.  That\\'s  for the  first  week anyway.  Now, it  depends--and  this  isthe  uncertainty--but  that would be  tighter than  last week in  terms  ofborrowing when we had the market  quite  tight with  a  lower level  ofborrowing.  We just  don\\'t know  the  significance  to  attach to  that.You might  be right,  but  it\\'s  not  in accordance with  the most  recentexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Not  the very recent  experience.\\x0c1/8-9/80-77-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That\\'s right.  Basically  the  $1 billionwas  arrived at--other than  that  it\\'s  a round number--by  being halfwaybetween  the  experience of  the  last  week and the  previous  week.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  It  would  seem to me  a lot  more  sensible  if  theCommittee  instructed the  Manager  to  seek  a total  reserve path thatwould  be  compatible with  these  [Ml  and M2  growth  rates]  rather  thanhave  the  FOMC  try to  estimate what  the  [appropriate]  level  ofborrowing is.  I think we  could eliminate  that  from  our  agenda  withoutany  loss,  and probably some  gain, before--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, you  are  going  to have  an  argument,  Isuspect,  with Governor Coldwell.  Let me  repeat.  I think what we  aredoing  is  that we  are  aiming  at  a  total  reserve path and  it\\'s  4-1/2percent  [Ml  growth]  under  this  version.  The  instrument  that we affectis  nonborrowed reserves.  What  we don\\'t  quite know how to  do  is  [howto  determine]  what  level  of  borrowed reserves  is  consistent with thetotal  reserves  path that  is  really the  objective.  That\\'s  engineeringin  Mr.  Roos\\'  terms,  I guess.  But  I\\'m telling you what  I propose  forthat  element  of  engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. ROOS.  If we worked with  a monetary base--and I know thatis  a dirty word--we\\'d  obviate all  these problems,  I think.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  It  does make  a difference what  the  source  ofreserves  is,  and we  should not  ignore  that.  It  may be  a refinement,but borrowed  reserves are not  quite  the  same  thing  as  owned  ornonborrowed reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  From my  standpoint,  I  suppose  I\\'d beperfectly happy with what you  suggested, Frank--just  leaving  it  to  theengineers,  as  Larry  said--but  I\\'m not  sure  the  Committee  as  a whole  iswilling to  leave  it  entirely  to  the  engineers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  President Morris,  if  you did  that,  some  of  thestaff  could sit  around and make  a decision  and say:  Well,  we  thinkborrowing ought  to  be  zero.  And  the  funds  rate would be  dropping verysharply  immediately.  We wouldn\\'t  make  such a  callous  arbitrary\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  I don\\'t  really understand  that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Well,  it\\'s  because  we  know required  reservesfor  next week, and the  Desk has  to  make  the  choice  of  whether  thoserequired  reserves will  be met  by borrowing at  the  discount window orthrough  the  Desk\\'s  provision of  nonborrowed reserves.  If  thoserequired reserves  happen  to  equal  the  total  reserves  that  seem proper,the Manager  still  has  to make  that  decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  But you  can\\'t  [play]  that  game  for  a quarter.You can do  it--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  but  that  is  always  the  position we  arein  for  any particular week.  Even  looking beyond the  week for  which weknow the  reserve number, we  know what  level  of  total  reserves  we wantto aim  for  to  [support]  4-1/2  percent  or whatever  the  number  is.  Whatwe  really don\\'t  know in a  sense  is  how to get  there,  because we  don\\'tcontrol  one  element in  the reserve base.\\x0c1/8-9/80-78-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  And,  therefore,  I don\\'t  think  it makes  any sensefor  the Committee  to  tell  the Manager  to  follow a nonborrowed  targetunless we  also  tell  him not  to  pay  attention to  total  reserves.  Now,in  the  last month he had to  change  the  nonborrowed target.  I thinkthat  was  the  correct  thing  to  do.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  if  I understand the  comment madeyesterday and this  is  combined with your comment, we  have to  get  somekind of  compromise.  We  are  interested in  total  reserves.  Our  successor  lack  of  success  in  reaching that  target will  depend upon, over  aperiod of  time,  how much  banks borrow  and how much we put  in  asnonborrowed reserves.  Taken together  it  will  depend on both  of  thosethings.  It  is  not  an indifferent decision  in looking  at  the  outlookwhether  they borrow or whether we put  in  the reserves.  Frankly, Ithink we have  to  leave  some room to  the  staff--or Mr. Sternlight,  Mr.Axilrod  and myself--in making  those  judgments  as  time  passes.Governor Coldwell yesterday  raised the  question as  to whether,  if  wemake a big change  in assumption,  the  Committee  [wants]  to  look a bitat  the  engineering, in Mr.  Roos\\'  term.  Now, I don\\'t  know at  whatpoint you want  to  do that,  if  at  all.  All  I\\'m suggesting by  throwingout  this  figure  is  that  this  is  at  least  a chance to  look at  theinitial  [borrowing]  assumption that goes  in--we meet  again only 4weeks  from now or whatever--and maybe  that\\'s  enough.  But  there was  aquestion about  that yesterday.  You don\\'t even have  to  look  at  theinitial  assumption  if you want  to  leave  it  to  us.  But  it\\'s  a matter--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  I really think  it\\'s meaningless.  But  if  peopleget some  solace  from it,  maybe  it\\'s  all  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  If you are willing to  convert  everything fromborrowing to  nonborrowed reserves,  sure, you can  call  it meaningless.I don\\'t believe  it  is meaningless.  I think it\\'s quite meaningful  ifwe  shift  from $1.5  billion of  borrowing to  zero borrowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  staff presumably would only  reach thatjudgment  in  the light  of  their  own assessment  as  to  whether  it\\'sconsistent with the  total  reserve  path.  They have  that  constraint.And if  they keep being  off  the  total  reserve path, presumably we willget  a new staff  or  something because  they are making the wrongjudgments.  But  that  is  an inevitable matter of  judgment  inherent  inthe discount window that  somebody has  to make.  It\\'s  a question ofprocedure  as  to how much  the Committee  wants  to  get  into  thatjudgment.  I tend to  agree with you,  Frank, that  the answer  is  \"nottoo much.\"  But  at  least  initially, when we\\'re meeting anyway,  it\\'s  aquestion of  how much we want  to--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman, I come  out right where Frank did.It\\'s not  only  the matter  of  borrowing,  it\\'s  a matter  of  whatliabilities  the banks use  up or  [whether they]  release  reserves thatare  not part  of  the money  supply.  All  those  things  have  to  beestimated  and  there are  a lot  of  them.  To me borrowing  involves  thesame  sort  of  problem.  I see  it  just  the way Frank does.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  if  you want  to proceed  this way,  Iwill  tell  you  instead of  asking you  in  a sense--and permit you  toobject--that  the staff  is  planning to  seek borrowing of  $1 billioninitially  and they will use  their  best  judgment  as  time passes.  Ifyou want  to  object  to  that,  object,  but  it  doesn\\'t have  to  be part  of\\x0c1/8-9/80-79-the  decision  in  any formal  sense.  I don\\'t  think we need  to  prolongthis  unless  somebody  really wants  to  object  to  that  Solomoniccompromise  between the  experience of  last week and  the  earlierexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  You mentioned the  staff  and  the  departure  ofthe  staff  if  we  are  off  the  total  reserve  path.  In  that  regard theCommittee  should remember  that  with lagged  reserve accounting, ifdeposits  turn  out  to  be  strong, borrowing will  rise  and  there  is  noway  in the  world to  get  back on  a total  reserve path  in as  short  aperiod as  4 weeks;  we are  going  to  have  to  wait  longer  for  the--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.  But  it  will  dictate  because we have  a 3-month--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No.  Whatever we  start  with, if  nothingelse goes  wrong  and we  are moving above path,  the  immediatemanifestation of  that  is  a rise  in  borrowing;  if  we  are moving belowpath, the  immediate manifestation  is  a decline  in  borrowing.  That\\'swhat happens.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  I don\\'t  want to prolong  this  either,  but  Ihave  some  confusion  on a  related point and  that  is  the role  of  thediscount rate.  I had been under  the  impression that  the  philosophy[at  the Board]  was  that,  given  lagged reserve accounting,  thedifferential between market  and  discount rates was  not  an effectivefactor  in  encouraging or  reducing  borrowing.  However,  in  the  Bluebookthere  is  a comment  in  paragraph 18  on page  17  about  what will  happenif  the  discount  rate  isn\\'t  changed under  certain circumstances  and  theinfluence  of  that  on borrowing.  Has  there  been further  thought  [atthe  Board]  about  that?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  say  that  the  question  of  laggedreserve  requirements, which keeps  coming  up  here,  and the  discountwindow posture, which bears  upon  this  question, are  under review.Within the  next  month or  so  I think we have  to  put  both of  thesematters,  certainly  the  reserve requirement  issue,  on  the  agenda.  Arewe going  to  be  ready in  time  for  the next meeting?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  That  lagged reserve  requirement  [study]  will  beready within a  couple of  weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  about  the  discount window?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  That will  not be  ready in  that  time  frame.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Not  before  the next meeting?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  I doubt  it.  It  could be  accelerated, but  Idon\\'t  think--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  point I am making is  mainly that  anycomment  at  the moment  is  tentative  depending upon where we  go  on  that.But given  the way we  are now operating--the  way  I look at  it  anyway--the  amount  of  borrowing presumably will  affect  the  level  of marketrates relative  to  the  discount  rate.  A  couple  of  comments were madethis morning.  Let\\'s  suppose borrowings  [have  to  go]  way down toachieve this  path.  For a while  at  least  the  discount  rate  is  going  toconstrain how  far  [the  funds  rate]  can go  down,  so  long as  the banks\\x0c1/8-9/80-80-are borrowing.  Now,  once  they  stop  borrowing,  it  can  go below thediscount  rate;  but so  long  as  they are borrowing  significantly,presumably market rates  will  not go  appreciably below  the  discountrate.  If  it  went  the  other way  and borrowings  tended to  increase,  onewould expect  interest  rates  to  go up  given  this  level  of  the  discountrate.  In  theory, I suppose,  we  could reduce  the  discount  rate  inthose  circumstances  and at  the  same  level  of  borrowing we might  getlower market  rates  in  the  short  run anyway than we  otherwise wouldhave.  So  the discount  rate  fairly  directly affects  the  market rate,all  other  things being  equal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EASTBURN.  The practical  aspect,  as  far  as  those  of  us  atthe  Reserve  Banks are  concerned, is  that we  do have  our  Board meetingsonce  every  14  days  and  they make recommendations  on  the  [discount]rate.  With a  fairly restrictive  directive  so  far  as  the  aggregatesare  concerned, there might  be  some  question  one way or  the  other  as  towhat  happens  to  this--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  judgment--I  think  I made  this pointbefore--seems  to me  to  be more  important  than it  used to be.  That\\'sbecause  if  you propose either  an  increase  or  a  decrease  in  thediscount  rate, we can basically say  that  the  message,  if  we\\'re  allinterpreting  it  the  same  way,  is  that we  want market  rates  higher  orlower.  We\\'re not  really  saying we want borrowing to be  greater orless,  although  that may be the  ultimate  implication  over  a period  oftime.  But  the  immediate effect  would be  to  change market  rates ratherthan borrowing.  Ultimately,  [a  new  discount  rate]  obviously mayaffect  borrowing because  it  has  affected  the climate  in  financialyou\\'re  sending the  Board a message  about  the  discount  rate, you\\'resending us  a message  on where you  think market  rates  should be, allother  things  equal.  Of  course,  this  is  why we didn\\'t  act  in  Octoberand November when market  rates  were  up wherever  they were--14  or  15percent  on  the  federal  funds  rate--and a  lot  of  people  said we  shouldraise  the  discount  rate  to  close  the gap.  It was  our  judgment  that,at  least  in the  short  run,  it  wasn\\'t  going  to close  the gap  but wasjust  going  to  put  the market  rates  up  further.  So  it was  a questionof  whether  or  not we  wanted market  rates  to  go up  further.  I thinkall  that  changes  if  we  open up  the  discount window.  If  we didn\\'t  havea natural  restraint  on  borrowing, which we have  had ever  since  thebeginning  of  the  Federal  Reserve System, but  if  we  operated  [with anattitude  of]  borrow all  you want if  you  find  the  rate attractive  toyou,  then  we\\'d have  to manage  the  discount rate  in  a different way.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  I do  think  that  the  level  of  borrowings  issomewhat  of  an  index  of  possible need.  That  is,  if  we  got  a high andrising  level  of  borrowings,  that would mean we\\'re  exceeding themonetary  targets  and  there would be more  indication  for  a rise  inrates  than if  we  got a  low and  declining level  of borrowing;  in thelatter case  [reserves]  probably would be  falling below target  and  thatwould  be consistent  with the  reduction so--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In  general.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Yes,  I don\\'t  think  it  really will  seem all  thatinconsistent over  time.\\x0c1/8-9/80-81-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Mr. Chairman,  could you  explain  how the discountrate  influences--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The market  rate?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  That\\'s  a  little  different  than  I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  Mr. Axilrod has  a nice  econometricfunction which hasn\\'t worked  so well  recently, but nonethelessreflects  the  theory.  Banks  are  reluctant  to  borrow.  Theirwillingness  to  overcome  their natural  reluctance  to borrow  dependsupon  how cheap the  discount  window is  relative  to market  rates.  Witha  given reluctance  to  borrow,  they will  borrow more  if  the margin  is  4percentage points  than  if  it\\'s  1 percentage point.  So,  if  you put upthe discount  rate and change  the  existing  situation in  the  margins butyou don\\'t  change  anything  else  including  the  amount of  borrowing,billion  in  the  current example.  In the  existing  situation that\\'s whatwe  say.  We  can  control  that  in  the  short  run.  We  know  they are goingto borrow  $1 billion.  We know,  if  this  equation  is  right,  that  theywill  only borrow  $1 billion when the  federal  funds  rate  is  1percentage point above  the  discount rate.  So we  now raise  thediscount  rate  from  12  to  13  percent;  they won\\'t borrow that  $1 billionthat we  are  going to  force  them  to  borrow until  the  federal  funds  rateis  14  percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Well,  that\\'s a very interesting view of  theworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  It  will  hold,  President Willes,  for  2 weeks;that\\'s  certain under  lagged reserve  requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Now, the higher  interest rates are  thengoing to  affect  everything else,  so we begin getting a differentanswer.  But  in  the  short  run  I think  that\\'s what  happens.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  That\\'s  implicitly assuming no change  in  excessreserves,  Mr.  Chairman.  I don\\'t  think that\\'s  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  Well,  the  changes  that can  occur,  such aschanges  in excess  reserves  and changes  in  total  deposits  that  bankscan bring  about,  would have  to be  enormous  in  order to  offset anysignificant  shortfall  of  reserves  because  the multipliers  are  so highfor M1.  That multiplier is  on  the  order  of  10  and  for M2  it\\'s  on  theorder  of  20,  so  banks would have  to  bring  enormous pressure on  theirborrowers and  the holders  of  securities  in  order  to make  up a  givenshortfall  in reserves  by changing their  reservable  liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  they change  their  liabilities,  it  willultimately affect reserves,  and that\\'s what  would occur  from  thehigher  level  of  interest  rates.  It\\'s  not  going  to  affect  reserves  for2 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  I\\'m  trying  to  say what  the  difference  isbetween  lagged and nonlagged  reserves.  It  is  a small  one,  as  far  asthe  [reserve]  adjustments  go.\\x0c1/8-9/80-82-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Because  even with nonlagged you  still  have  thistremendous  multiplier.  Yes,  I agree.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  That\\'s  right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Well,  I don\\'t want  to prolong  the  discussion,but  it  makes me very nervous  that  we  would take what  in  effect  is  adeterministic, very short-run model  and  decide  the  time path  forchanges  in  the  discount rate,  then market  rates.  I think  that\\'s  avery questionable  thing to  do.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I don\\'t understand  quite  what you aresaying.  It  doesn\\'t mean  that  we can\\'t  change  the discount  rate.  Itjust  tells us  to  recognize  that  if  we change  the  discount rate,  theshort-run  impact  is  going  to be  to  put market rates  up, which may bewhat  you want.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Well,  what\\'s  the  short  run?  Is  it  2 weeks  or  4weeks  or  6 weeks?  We  could  get  exactly the  opposite  results  if  youchange  the  time  horizon by a relatively  small  amount.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don\\'t  know about  the  small  amount.  Butthere\\'s  no  question  that  if  you put up  interest  rates,  the ultimateresult  might be  to  reduce  the money  supply, which might  have all  sortsof  impacts  and produce  lower rates  over  a period  of  time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WILLES.  Fairly quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I\\'m  talking  about  the  immediate impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Reduce  the money supply and  get  lower  interestrates!\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we  don\\'t  have  to  wait--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  COLDWELL.  Do you want  comments  on  this  compromise  orMr. Chairman, I\\'d rather  have  [a  range]what  are  you  going  to do? centered on  4 percent  than the  4-1/2  percent you\\'ve  chosen.  The[risks]  of  5 percent  are  too high  to me.  I think  we ought  to beaiming  for  something less  than  that  in  this  coming  quarter  to  makesure we  do  not  overstimulate at  this  particular moment,  and  I\\'d muchrather  we have  a  4 percent rate.  The  range  could be  3-1/2  to  4-1/2percent  if we want  a  center  point;  or  for  a  single point  4 percentwould be my strong  preference.  With  the  $1 billion in borrowing  Ihave no problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any other  comment?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WALLICH.  I  feel  somewhat  the  same way.  Evidently these[choices]  do  not matter a  great deal  [individually],  but  thecombination  of what  seems  to me  historically low borrowing,  anunchanged lower  end  of  the  funds  rate,  and  a somewhat  higher rate  ofM1  [growth]  all  cumulates  a  little  in my view.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. PARTEE.  Well,  I am on  the  opposite  side.  Somebody needsto  speak.  It  looks  as  if  the  chances  are  that  we will  have somethinglike  5 percent  [Ml]  growth.  I don\\'t  think we  ought  to  be deliberatelyfollowing a mechanism that  pushes rates  up  in  this  quarter, which  is\\x0c1/8-9/80-83-probably a declining  quarter  in  the  economy.  I\\'m prepared  to  have  4to  5 percent  to  accommodate  other members,  but  I certainly wouldn\\'twant  to  center  [the  range]  on  4 percent,  which  I think does  bias  it  infavor  of  a rise  in  interest rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  I also  think it\\'s  the  wrong  time  to  haveinterest  rates going up.  If  the  economy  slides  off,  for once weshould be  going with  it  rather  than  lagging behind  it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  Steve,  I thought  you  said alternative C wasconsistent  [with  the current]  rate,  not  an upward  [move  in  the]  rate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Alternative C  in  the  first  quarter we assumewould be  [consistent with]  something  like  the present  interest  ratelevel;  it  might go  down a bit,  but more  likely--\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. COLDWELL.  [Down]  a bit,  but not upward.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Not  in the  first  quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.  TEETERS.  But  it  seems  to  me we want  to  have  someflexibility here.  If  the  economy does  slide  off,  I think we\\'d want  tosee  interest  rates  slide off.  If  we go  to  a very stringent  monetarypolicy of  4 percent  [Ml  growth],  we  are  sort  of  gluing  the  [funds]rate  at  14  percent with a possibility  of  it  going higher.  As  I say,it  would be  nice  for  once  to  have  Fed policy moving  in  sync  with  theeconomy.  And if  the economy  doesn\\'t  slide  off,  the  interest rate  isnot  going to  come  down.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SCHULTZ.  As  I see  it,  Steve  said  the best  estimate thestaff  can make at  this  time  is  that  January  [Ml  growth]  looks  like  5percent.  That would mean  that  if  we center  it  on 4 percent,  we\\'regoing  to  have  to  have  some  additional restraint  at  this  point  in  time,and  I\\'m not  sure  that  that\\'s  that we want.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any other  comments?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BLACK.  For  once, Mr.  Chairman, though Governor Rice  andI voted  at  [opposite]  ends  of  this  spectrum, we have  agreed  thateither  of  us  could accept the  other\\'s position.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it\\'s  a pretty  fine  judgment when youget  down  to  1/2  percentage point  differences.  But  I would  suggest  toboth sides  that  under my  interpretation  of  this  the  degree ofresistance  to  either  end  of  the range  is  somewhat affected by whatdoes happen  to  interest  rates, which  I don\\'t  think we  know.  That  iswhere the concern  is  on  either  side,  and  the  concern is  a reasonableone.  But  I get  a little  leeway  in  there.  Now, one  can argue  that M1can be put  a  little  higher  or a  little  lower but  if  there  aren\\'t anyother comments,  I guess we can vote.  Is  this  package understandable?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.

There were  a couple  of  other  things  Iwanted to mention, which  I\\'m not  sure  I remember  now.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MAYO.  Don\\'t  mess  it  up!\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  not  on  [the  policy decision].  I  justwant  to  remind you  again  that  both the  discount  window procedures  andlagged reserve  accounting  are relevant  to  what we  are  doing, and  if  weare  really  going  to  stay on  this  technique,  they urgently needexamination.  We  are not  talking  about  any easy  change  in either  ofthose,  if  we want  to  change.  While  the  surface  logic  seems  to  say  tochange  from lagged  reserve accounting,  I suspect  it  would not  be  easyto  do  that mechanically  in the  banking  system, particularly beforemembership gets  resolved.  I\\'m  just not  sure how easy it  is  to  do.  Ifwe  are really  talking about  changing  the  discount  window mechanism tosomething that  seems  to me  logically more  consistent with thisoperating technique,  again on  first  blush,  I suspect we  are  talkingabout  overthrowing  60  years  of  Federal  Reserve history, which is  notan  easy thing to  do  either.  So  they are  not going  to be very simplequestions to  deal  with, but  they are  inherent  in  this  operatingtechnique.We had  an agenda  item on  release  of  the  FOMC Memoranda  ofDiscussion  for  1974.

Without  objection,  that  shall  be  released.The next  meeting  is  February  5.  I would assume  that  the  discussion  onthe  long-range targets,  having  had  [this  preliminary]  discussiontoday, can  go  reasonably expeditiously.  And on that basis  I assume wecan do  it  all  in  the  morning.  We do have  the  lagged reserveaccounting question.  We probably will not  have  a discount windowquestion  [to  consider]  by that  point.  I would hope  to  get  somethingon  the  lagged reserve  accounting  out  to  all  the members  of  theCommittee before  the  meeting and  that  discussion.  The meeting timedoesn\\'t  necessarily have  to  be  extended  at  this point.  We  probablyaren\\'t at  a point  to make  a decision right now.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  in  view of  yesterday afternoon\\'sdiscussion,  the basic GNP  forecast would probably assume an M-1Agrowth  rate  of  something under  6 percent.  The  staff  in  its wisdomwill  have  to  decide  on somewhere  around  5 to  5-1/2  percent  to  beconsistent with that  discussion.  In  any event,  we would have  somealternatives  to  interpolate.\\x0c1/8-9/80-86-\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  have  a problem.  You  remind me.

I don\\'t  think  it  technically  requiresthat.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR.  PARTEE.

Very  littleattention was  paid to  it,  though.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  raises a bit  of  a question  in my mindon whether it  is  worthwhile  polling the  Committee on what  theireconomic  outlook  is.  We went  through  that  exercise  once  or  twice withMr. Miller.  Do  people want  to be polled on what  their  economic  lookis?  Is  it  a useful  exercise?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMS.

Well,  we  also  have  a request  from  a memberof  the  Committee.  Willis Winn sent  me a  letter raising  all  sorts  ofinteresting  questions  on  the  international  scene--I  don\\'t know whether\\x0c1/8-9/80-87-that  letter was  distributed other  than  to  the  Board members--andsuggested  that  it  might be  a good  idea  to  have  a general  discussion  ofthe  international  scene.  Some  of  the  questions  are  quite  profound.That  raises  the  question  in my mind whether  [to  allocate more  time  fordiscussion].  While  I think we  can pretty  clearly do  the work we haveto  do  in February in  the morning, would there be  any desire  in view ofthat  and perhaps  a  discussion of  lagged  reserve  accounting  and  inter-related matters  to  begin the  discussion  the  afternoon before?  I\\'m notsure  it  would have  to  be a meeting;  it  could be  a discussion  theafternoon before.  How do people  feel  about  that?\\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORRIS.

There were no System open market \\r\\n    transactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no \\r\\n    vote was required of the Committee.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on \\r\\n    developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market \\r\\n    transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations \\r\\n    during the period December 22, 1992, through February 2, 1993. By \\r\\n    unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic \\r\\n    outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1993, and the \\r\\n    implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. \\r\\n    A summary of the economic and financial information available at the \\r\\n    time of the meeting and of the Committee\\'s discussion is provided \\r\\n    below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by \\r\\n    the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicated that \\r\\n    economic activity rose appreciably further in the fourth quarter. \\r\\n    Final demands were buoyed by strength in consumption, business \\r\\n    spending for durable equipment, and residential construction. \\r\\n    Manufacturing activity also increased considerably, and employment \\r\\n    appeared to be on a modest upward trajectory, despite a continuing \\r\\n    flow of announcements of layoffs by large corporations. Although \\r\\n    recent data on wages and prices had been mixed, on balance they \\r\\n    suggested that inflation was trending gradually lower.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment registered a small increase \\r\\n    in December for the fourth consecutive month. Service industries, \\r\\n    notably business and health services, and retail trade accounted for \\r\\n    nearly all of the rise in jobs. Manufacturing and construction \\r\\n    payrolls changed little, and government employment fell as temporary \\r\\n    election workers were dropped from payrolls. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point below \\r\\n    its mid-year peak but slightly above its level at the beginning of the \\r\\n    year.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIndustrial production advanced further in December and was up \\r\\n    considerably over the fourth quarter as a whole. Motor vehicle \\r\\n    assemblies rose sharply during the quarter; strong gains also were \\r\\n    registered in business equipment, partly reflecting a further jump in \\r\\n    output of computers, and in nondurable consumer goods. By contrast, \\r\\n    the production of durable consumer goods other than motor vehicles was \\r\\n    lower on balance after changing little over the third quarter, and the \\r\\n    output of defense and space equipment remained on a downward trend. \\r\\n    Total utilization of industrial capacity increased significantly in \\r\\n    the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nConsumer spending was up substantially in the fourth quarter. \\r\\n    Retail sales, after rising sharply in October and changing little in \\r\\n    November, posted a further sizable increase in December. The largest \\r\\n    sales gains in the fourth quarter were reported at automotive dealers \\r\\n    and at building material and supply outlets, but most other types of \\r\\n    retail stores also recorded higher sales. By contrast, consumer \\r\\n    spending for services, as indicated by data on personal consumption \\r\\n    expenditures, rose more slowly. Housing starts surged in December, \\r\\n    with single family starts reaching their highest level in nearly three \\r\\n    years and multifamily starts picking up slightly from the very low \\r\\n    levels of October and November. Sales of new and existing homes \\r\\n    remained on a strong upward trend in December.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nReal outlays for business fixed investment apparently \\r\\n    registered a notable gain in the fourth quarter, particularly for \\r\\n    producers\\' durable equipment. Shipments of nondefense capital goods \\r\\n    rose in November and December after changing little in October; for \\r\\n    the quarter as a whole, shipments advanced substantially, with \\r\\n    increases widespread by category. Business purchases of cars and \\r\\n    trucks were up sharply in the fourth quarter, while nonresidential \\r\\n    construction activity retraced a small part of a third-quarter \\r\\n    decline.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBusiness inventories expanded moderately in November as a \\r\\n    sizable drop in manufacturing inventories was more than offset by \\r\\n    increases in wholesale and retail inventories. At the manufacturing \\r\\n    level, the drawdown of stocks was associated with strong shipments of \\r\\n    durable goods, and inventory-to-shipments ratios in most industries \\r\\n    were at or near the bottom of their recent ranges. In the wholesale \\r\\n    sector, sizable inventory increases were reported in November for a \\r\\n    second straight month; most of the buildup was limited to machinery, \\r\\n    motor vehicles, and miscellaneous nondurable goods. With stocks \\r\\n    rising in line with sales since September, the stock-to-sales ratio in \\r\\n    wholesaling remained at the low end of its range over the past year. \\r\\n    Retail inventories increased moderately further in November; the \\r\\n    inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector was slightly below its average \\r\\n    for previous months of the year.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly \\r\\n    in November. For October and November together, however, the deficit \\r\\n    narrowed a little from its average rate in the third quarter, as the \\r\\n    value of exports rose more than the value of imports. Most of the \\r\\n    increase in exports was in capital goods, both machinery and aircraft, \\r\\n    and in consumer goods. Passenger cars accounted for a considerable \\r\\n    part of the rise in imports, while the inflow of consumer goods eased \\r\\n    from the very strong pace of the third quarter. Recent indicators \\r\\n    suggested that economic activity had remained weak in the major \\r\\n    foreign industrial countries and that unemployment rates had increased \\r\\n    further in most of those countries. The recovery in Canada appeared \\r\\n    to be continuing, but the downturn in western Germany and Japan \\r\\n    evidently had persisted into the fourth quarter.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nA small November decline in producer prices of finished \\r\\n    goods was reversed in December, with a rebound in prices of finished \\r\\n    foods outweighing a further drop in energy prices. For finished items \\r\\n    other than food and energy, producer prices rose in December, but the \\r\\n    advance followed six months of no change on balance; for 1992 as a \\r\\n    whole, this measure of prices increased by a considerably smaller \\r\\n    amount than in 1991. At the consumer level, the index for prices of \\r\\n    nonfood, non-energy items edged higher in December after somewhat \\r\\n    larger increases in the two preceding months. The rise in this index \\r\\n    in 1992 was the smallest for any year since the early 1970s, when wage \\r\\n    and price controls were in effect. Hourly compensation of private \\r\\n    industry workers advanced a little more rapidly in the fourth quarter \\r\\n    than in the two previous quarters, but the rise in total compensation \\r\\n    over the year as a whole was considerably smaller than in 1991. The \\r\\n    slowing of labor cost increases last year occurred in both the wages \\r\\n    and benefits components.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAt its meeting on December 22, the Committee adopted a \\r\\n    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure \\r\\n    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the \\r\\n    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting \\r\\n    period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of \\r\\n    the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and \\r\\n    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to \\r\\n    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater \\r\\n    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be \\r\\n    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions \\r\\n    associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with \\r\\n    expansion of M2 at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent and with M3 \\r\\n    remaining about unchanged on balance over the four-month period from \\r\\n    November through March.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nOpen market operations during the intermeeting period were \\r\\n    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve \\r\\n    positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was well above expected \\r\\n    levels in the first two full reserve maintenance periods in the \\r\\n    intermeeting interval; borrowing was sizable over the long New Year\\'s \\r\\n    weekend and also later when unusually heavy Treasury tax receipts \\r\\n    drained reserves from the banking system. The federal funds rate \\r\\n    averaged close to expected levels over the intermeeting period. \\r\\n    However, the rate was somewhat volatile in late December as a result \\r\\n    of sizable swings in market factors affecting reserves and of shifting \\r\\n    market anticipations regarding year-end pressures.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nMost other short-term interest rates declined somewhat over \\r\\n    the intermeeting period, in part reflecting the passing of year-end \\r\\n    pressures. Intermediate- and long-term rates, including those on \\r\\n    fixed-rate mortgages, also moved somewhat lower; the declines occurred \\r\\n    in response to growing indications that any proposed near-term fiscal \\r\\n    stimulus would be quite moderate and that the new Administration \\r\\n    intended to recommend steps, possibly including new taxes, to lower \\r\\n    the trajectory of the fiscal deficit appreciably over time. Broad \\r\\n    indexes of stock prices exhibited mixed results over the intermeeting \\r\\n    period: Indexes giving heavy weight to large companies changed \\r\\n    little, while those primarily reflecting smaller companies rose \\r\\n    significantly.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the \\r\\n    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over the \\r\\n    intermeeting period. Through early January, the dollar appreciated \\r\\n    against both the yen and the mark, especially the latter, in response \\r\\n    to actual and expected further declines in interest rates in Japan and \\r\\n    Germany. Subsequently, the dollar\\'s gains were partially erased as \\r\\n    the prospects for near-term easing in Germany diminished somewhat and \\r\\n    perceptions grew that fiscal initiatives in the United States would \\r\\n    lower the deficit and reduce the chances that monetary policy might be \\r\\n    tightened in the months ahead.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAfter expanding at a moderate pace over the course of earlier \\r\\n    months, M2 contracted in December and January. Some of the weakness \\r\\n    reflected a slowdown in Ml growth associated with lower mortgage \\r\\n    refinancing activity. Within M2\\'s nontransaction component, the \\r\\n    expansion of savings and money market deposit accounts slowed \\r\\n    abruptly, perhaps owing in part to the wider spread that had developed \\r\\n    during the fall between market rates and those paid on these accounts, \\r\\n    as well as to the use of monies in these accounts to fund a step-up in \\r\\n    consumer purchases and nonwithheld tax payments. In addition, the \\r\\n    continued attractiveness to investors of bond and stock mutual funds \\r\\n    might have contributed to a quickening of the runoff of holdings of \\r\\n    money market mutual funds and to the persisting weakness in other M2 \\r\\n    accounts. Appreciable declines in M3 in December and January \\r\\n    reflected both the contraction in M2 and reduced needs by banks for \\r\\n    managed liabilities at a time of weak overall credit demand. From the \\r\\n    fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3 \\r\\n    grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee\\'s annual \\r\\n    ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have expanded at \\r\\n    the lower end of the Committee\\'s monitoring range for 1992.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that \\r\\n    economic activity would expand over the year ahead at a pace that \\r\\n    would be sufficient to reduce gradually margins of unemployed labor \\r\\n    and capital. Recent declines in long-term interest rates and more \\r\\n    optimistic attitudes on the part of businesses and households were \\r\\n    expected to support further solid gains in business fixed investment \\r\\n    and in homebuying. Continuing progress in reducing debt service \\r\\n    burdens and a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security \\r\\n    were projected to foster an expansion of consumer spending a shade \\r\\n    faster than the growth in incomes. Export demand would be damped for \\r\\n    some period of time by the appreciation of the dollar since mid-1992, \\r\\n    but an anticipated pickup in growth abroad later this year would begin \\r\\n    to counteract the effects of the higher dollar. Against the \\r\\n    background of considerable uncertainties associated with still \\r\\n    unannounced fiscal policy initiatives, the staff retained for this \\r\\n    forecast the assumption contained in several previous forecasts that \\r\\n    fiscal policy would remain mildly restrictive, largely because of \\r\\n    declining defense outlays. The persisting slack in resource \\r\\n    utilization over the forecast horizon was expected to be associated \\r\\n    with some additional progress in reducing inflation.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective \\r\\n    economic developments, the members were encouraged by the mounting \\r\\n    evidence of appreciable momentum in the economic expansion. On the \\r\\n    whole, recent developments tended to reinforce their forecasts of \\r\\n    continuing growth at a moderate pace over the year ahead, especially \\r\\n    in light of the improvement in business and consumer confidence. The \\r\\n    impact of some retarding influences on the expansion, notably various \\r\\n    balance sheet adjustment activities, appeared to be waning. In \\r\\n    addition, while some major sectors of the economy such as defense \\r\\n    spending and commercial construction remained weak, the economy was \\r\\n    benefitting from considerable growth in consumer spending, from rising \\r\\n    business expenditures for producer equipment, and from increasing \\r\\n    outlays for housing. In one view, the recent behavior of commodity \\r\\n    prices also tended to indicate some strengthening in the economy\\'s \\r\\n    expansion. Despite various indications of a more firmly established \\r\\n    expansion, however, the members felt that the outlook remained subject \\r\\n    to a good deal of uncertainty, and some commented that substantial \\r\\n    deviations--in either direction--from their current forecasts could \\r\\n    not be ruled out. It was noted in this connection that the specifics \\r\\n    of the President\\'s fiscal policy proposals were still unknown, and \\r\\n    their reception by the public and the Congress would have a major \\r\\n    influence on confidence, interest rates, and the performance of the \\r\\n    economy. Other sources of uncertainty related to the outlook for \\r\\n    further restructuring activities that involved cutbacks in operations \\r\\n    and employment by many firms, and the prospective lending policies of \\r\\n    banking institutions. With regard to the outlook for inflation, most \\r\\n    of the members believed that some further progress toward stable \\r\\n    prices was likely over the year ahead, given an economic outcome about \\r\\n    in line with their forecasts of continued, albeit reduced, margins of \\r\\n    unutilized or underutilized productive resources. Some members also \\r\\n    referred to the extended period of relatively sluggish growth in the \\r\\n    broad measures of money as a favorable indicator in the outlook for \\r\\n    inflation.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee \\r\\n    establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt \\r\\n    aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank \\r\\n    presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections \\r\\n    of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for \\r\\n    1993. The central tendencies of the forecasts pointed to slightly \\r\\n    faster economic growth this year than currently seemed to have \\r\\n    occurred in 1992. The anticipated rate of economic expansion would be \\r\\n    at a pace that was rapid enough to reduce the rate of unemployment a \\r\\n    little further. Nonetheless, with some slack in productive resources \\r\\n    persisting, price and cost pressures would remain subdued and modest \\r\\n    additional moderation in inflation was expected by most members. \\r\\n    Measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of \\r\\n    1993, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 \\r\\n    to 3-1/4 percent within a full range of 2-1/2 to 4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of \\r\\n    1993 were concentrated in the upper half of a 6-1/2 to 7 percent \\r\\n    range.  For the  CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the  \\r\\n    period from the  fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of  1993  \\r\\n    was  centered on  increases in  a range of 2-1/2 to  2-3/4 percent, and  \\r\\n    for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6 \\r\\n    percent for the year.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn the course of the Committee\\'s discussion of various \\r\\n    factors underlying the outlook for economic activity, the members \\r\\n    observed that on the whole the effects of a number of structural \\r\\n    impediments to the expansion seemed to be diminishing as the financial \\r\\n    condition of households, business firms, and financial institutions \\r\\n    continued to improve. Household and business debt-service burdens had \\r\\n    eased substantially, but it remained difficult to predict to what \\r\\n    extent and for how long the ongoing balance sheet adjustments would \\r\\n    continue to divert an unusual proportion of cash flows from spending \\r\\n    to balance sheet repair. Improved profitability and new capital-market issuance had strengthened the capital positions of banking \\r\\n    institutions, and in general they were now in a much better position \\r\\n    to augment their lending activities. However, there were few \\r\\n    indications thus far of any easing in terms or standards on business \\r\\n    loans, and the depressed and uncertain values of commercial mortgages \\r\\n    and real estate held in bank portfolios might continue to exert an \\r\\n    inhibiting effect on the willingness of banks to lend. Another \\r\\n    negative factor was the persistence of downsizing and other \\r\\n    restructuring activities by numerous firms, notably large businesses. \\r\\n    Such restructuring activities had not fully run their course as many \\r\\n    firms continued to pare excess production capacity and to modernize \\r\\n    production facilities to meet strong competition in domestic and \\r\\n    foreign markets. The resulting layoffs had damped overall job growth.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nDespite tepid job growth, retail sales had strengthened \\r\\n    markedly during the closing months of 1992, and several members \\r\\n    commented that such sales had continued to display surprising vigor in \\r\\n    some parts of the country during the early weeks of 1993. Apart from \\r\\n    the improvement in consumer sentiment, other favorable factors cited \\r\\n    with regard to the outlook for consumer spending included lower debt-service burdens and the capital gains or enhanced cash flows now being \\r\\n    realized as sales of homes picked up and mortgage refinancings again \\r\\n    strengthened. Some members nonetheless expressed a degree of concern \\r\\n    about the sustainability of the gains in consumer spending unless \\r\\n    there were faster growth in employment and income to support such \\r\\n    spending. Announcements by prominent firms of cutbacks in their \\r\\n    workforces had continued into the new year, and while job gains at \\r\\n    other firms, especially smaller ones, were contributing to modest net \\r\\n    growth in overall employment, the publicity surrounding the persisting \\r\\n    job cutbacks and a tendency for many new jobs to be lower-paying added \\r\\n    an element of caution to the outlook for consumer expenditures. On \\r\\n    balance, with the measured saving rate already at a low level, though \\r\\n    an argument could be made that the actual rate was somewhat higher \\r\\n    than indicated by the currently published data, consumer spending \\r\\n    seemed likely to expand about in line with the growth in consumer \\r\\n    incomes over the coming year.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe growth in consumer incomes in turn was likely to depend \\r\\n    importantly on the expansion in business investment spending, and \\r\\n    members cited a number of factors that were expected to provide a \\r\\n    favorable setting for sustained momentum in such spending over the \\r\\n    year ahead. These included the strengthening of final demands, the \\r\\n    recent declines in intermediate -and long-term interest rates, the \\r\\n    greater leeway for financial intermediaries to increase their lending \\r\\n    to businesses, and a continuing desire by business firms to improve \\r\\n    their operating efficiencies. Commercial construction activity, \\r\\n    however, was likely to remain quite sluggish. There were indications \\r\\n    that commercial real estate values had stabilized in a number of \\r\\n    areas, but at low levels, and given the persistence of marked \\r\\n    imbalances in numerous real estate markets that were the result of \\r\\n    several years of overbuilding, a significant rebound in commercial \\r\\n    building activity for the nation as a whole might well be several \\r\\n    years away. The outlook for housing construction was much more \\r\\n    promising. Against the background of a general upswing in consumer \\r\\n    confidence and the improved balance sheets of many households, the \\r\\n    declines that had occurred in mortgage interest rates had fostered a \\r\\n    marked strengthening in the demand for single-family housing as \\r\\n    evidenced by reports from many parts of the country as well as the \\r\\n    overall statistics on housing. On the basis of these developments, \\r\\n    the members anticipated a continuing impetus to the economic expansion \\r\\n    from housing construction and from related industries over the year \\r\\n    ahead. In addition, the current indications of generally lean \\r\\n    business inventories, associated in part with strong final demands \\r\\n    over the past several months, suggested that the prospects for further \\r\\n    gains in overall spending were likely to stimulate efforts by business \\r\\n    firms to build up inventories over the quarters ahead.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe increasing signs of slow growth or recession in a number \\r\\n    of foreign nations represented a greater downside risk to the demand \\r\\n    for U.S. exports than had been apparent earlier. It was noted, for \\r\\n    example, that firms engaged in business activities abroad were \\r\\n    reporting substantial deterioration in markets for U.S. goods in many \\r\\n    foreign countries. Growth in U.S. exports might remain positive over \\r\\n    the year ahead, but against the background of a relatively expansive \\r\\n    U.S. economy and the dollar\\'s recent appreciation, the value of \\r\\n    exports might well fall increasingly short of that of imports with \\r\\n    adverse effects on the growth of U.S. economic activity.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nTurning to the outlook for fiscal policy, members were \\r\\n    encouraged by the prospect that the President would soon propose a \\r\\n    program that would produce substantial reductions in the federal \\r\\n    deficit over the years ahead. Such a deficit-reduction program, if \\r\\n    deemed credible, could result in lower intermediate- and long-term \\r\\n    interest rates than would otherwise prevail--even before the program \\r\\n    was enacted--with very positive implications for interest-sensitive \\r\\n    expenditures. For the nearer term, the President was expected to \\r\\n    announce some modest fiscal stimulus relative to what was currently in \\r\\n    train. However, the specifics of the President\\'s proposals were not \\r\\n    yet known and there was little current basis on which to judge \\r\\n    prospective public and Congressional reactions. Members emphasized \\r\\n    the critical need for long-term deficit reduction, and some expressed \\r\\n    concern about the adverse effects on financial markets if fiscal \\r\\n    stimulus measures were to be enacted for the short run without the \\r\\n    assurance of further legislation to cut federal deficits over time.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation, most of the members \\r\\n    anticipated that the trend toward lower price and wage inflation would \\r\\n    be sustained over the year ahead, and one member observed that the \\r\\n    disinflationary momentum in the economy might well be underestimated. \\r\\n    Favorable developments relating to the outlook for inflation included \\r\\n    evidence of slowing increases in labor costs and continued aggressive \\r\\n    efforts by many business firms to improve productivity and reduce \\r\\n    costs in the face of intense competition from domestic and foreign \\r\\n    producers. Indeed, anecdotal reports from around the country \\r\\n    continued to suggest little or no upward pressure on prices in many \\r\\n    regions. In addition, the behavior of interest rates in longer-term \\r\\n    debt markets was consistent with spreading expectations of gradually \\r\\n    diminishing inflation. Some members believed, however, that little or \\r\\n    no further progress in reducing inflation was a more likely outcome in \\r\\n    the year ahead, though none anticipated higher inflation. Some \\r\\n    commodity price indexes had edged higher recently, apparently in \\r\\n    response to growing demands related to strengthening activity in \\r\\n    several sectors of the economy. Lumber prices in particular had risen \\r\\n    considerably in conjunction with the uptrend in single-family housing \\r\\n    construction and various constraints on lumber supplies. Some \\r\\n    business contacts reported for the first time in a long while that \\r\\n    they were experiencing or anticipated some upward pressure on their \\r\\n    raw materials prices. Further, while most business contacts saw or \\r\\n    anticipated little or no upward pressure on prices in their own \\r\\n    industries, many continued to expect rising inflation more generally. \\r\\n    The still relatively steep slope of the yield curve and its \\r\\n    implications with regard to expectations of future increases in \\r\\n    interest rates also suggested that investors remained concerned about \\r\\n    the possibility of higher inflation over the longer run, even though \\r\\n    such concerns might have abated somewhat recently and did not appear \\r\\n    to extend to the next year or two. In general, however, the members \\r\\n    viewed the inflation outlook with considerable optimism on the \\r\\n    presumption of favorable fiscal and monetary policy developments.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and \\r\\n    Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee \\r\\n    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and \\r\\n    debt aggregates in 1993 that it had established on a tentative basis \\r\\n    at its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1992. The tentative ranges included \\r\\n    expansion of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3, \\r\\n    measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of \\r\\n    1993. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial \\r\\n    debt had been set provisionally at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1993. \\r\\n    All of these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had \\r\\n    set for 1992 at its meeting in February of last year and had reaffirmed at mid-year. When the provisional ranges for money growth were \\r\\n    established, the Committee had noted that they were especially \\r\\n    tentative and subject to revision in the latter part of 1992 or early \\r\\n    1993 owing to the considerable uncertainty about the evolving \\r\\n    relationship of money to income.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn the event, the velocities of M2 and M3 had increased \\r\\n    appreciably in the second half of 1992 and analysis of the factors \\r\\n    behind this development suggested further increases in the year ahead. \\r\\n    Consequently, in the Committee\\'s discussion, which tended to focus on \\r\\n    M2, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to \\r\\n    lower the tentative ranges for growth of the broad monetary aggregates \\r\\n    by one-half percentage point for 1993. At the same time, a number of \\r\\n    members indicated that they preferred somewhat different ranges \\r\\n    including the retention of the tentative ranges, lowering the ranges \\r\\n    by more than the proposal, and widening or narrowing them. All the \\r\\n    members were in firm agreement that the purpose of the proposed \\r\\n    reductions was not to signal or implement any change in monetary \\r\\n    policy or to convey any intention to move away from the Committee\\'s \\r\\n    commitment to maximum sustainable economic expansion. Rather, the \\r\\n    reductions were motivated by the persistence of marked shortfalls in \\r\\n    the growth of M2 and M3 from their historical relationships with \\r\\n    various measures of aggregate economic performance; those shortfalls \\r\\n    appeared to be the technical result of forces that are altering the \\r\\n    relationship between money and income. Members of the Committee urged \\r\\n    that the Board\\'s report to Congress and the Chairman\\'s accompanying \\r\\n    testimony make clear the reasons for the unusual behavior of money and \\r\\n    its consequences for the Committee\\'s choice of ranges.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe deviations in monetary growth from historical norms \\r\\n    reflected a number of developments whose relative importance and \\r\\n    intensity had shifted to some extent over the course of recent years, \\r\\n    but in general they had served to rechannel funds away from depository \\r\\n    institutions, and the associated weakness in deposit growth had raised \\r\\n    velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to money. The result was the need \\r\\n    for lower money growth than in the past to support a given rate of \\r\\n    income growth. Among the developments that had tended to retard the \\r\\n    relative growth of M2 and M3 was the unprecedented steepness of the \\r\\n    yield curve that had prompted large shifts of funds by savers from M2 \\r\\n    accounts to higher-yielding intermediate- and long-term assets. At \\r\\n    the same time, credit growth at bank and thrift depository \\r\\n    institutions had been weak, partly as a result of efforts by these \\r\\n    institutions to improve capital and liquidity positions, and partly \\r\\n    owing to weak demand. As a consequence, they also had maintained \\r\\n    relatively low offering rates on deposits that had provided consumers \\r\\n    with an incentive to reduce or hold down their deposit holdings in \\r\\n    order to pay down relatively high cost mortgages and other debts. In \\r\\n    1992, sluggish growth of M2 and M3 had been associated with a \\r\\n    considerable acceleration in nominal spending. Indeed, despite growth \\r\\n    of both M2 and M3 at rates below the Committee\\'s ranges, the expansion \\r\\n    of the economy had exceeded most forecasts.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe members generally anticipated that the intensity of these \\r\\n    forces might diminish in 1993 as borrowers and lending institutions \\r\\n    achieved more comfortable balance sheet positions. Nonetheless, the \\r\\n    relative weakness in money growth was seen as likely to persist to a \\r\\n    marked extent. The yield curve, while it had flattened a bit \\r\\n    recently, was still expected to provide a considerable incentive for \\r\\n    many savers to shift funds out of M2 assets, especially as relatively \\r\\n    high-yielding time deposits continued to mature. In addition, banks \\r\\n    were likely to remain generally unaggressive in bidding for deposits, \\r\\n    in part because their substantial earlier acquisitions of securities \\r\\n    would permit them to accommodate some of the anticipated growth in \\r\\n    loan demand by selling securities or limiting purchases. In these \\r\\n    circumstances, restrained money growth seemed likely to remain \\r\\n    consistent with relative strength in the economic expansion.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe members recognized that the strength of the factors that \\r\\n    were expected to continue to depress broad money growth in relation to \\r\\n    income in 1993 was still subject to considerable uncertainty, and this \\r\\n    implied the need for flexibility in assessing the implications of \\r\\n    money growth relative to the Committee\\'s ranges. Should the factors \\r\\n    influencing the behavior of the broad aggregates persist in holding \\r\\n    down money growth to the extent seen in 1992, expansion of M2 and M3 \\r\\n    in the lower portion of their reduced ranges would be consistent with \\r\\n    considerable further growth in nominal spending. Indeed, a shortfall \\r\\n    from the reduced ranges could not be ruled out, and one member felt \\r\\n    that the potential for such a development warranted consideration of a \\r\\n    somewhat larger reduction in the M2 range; such a reduction also would \\r\\n    signal more clearly the Committee\\'s commitment to price stability. On \\r\\n    the other hand, the upper portions of the reduced ranges would still \\r\\n    accommodate an ample provision of liquidity to support further \\r\\n    economic expansion even if the growth of money and of income were to \\r\\n    move toward an historically more normal alignment and velocity were to \\r\\n    slow from its high rate of increase. In one view, widening the \\r\\n    tentative M2 range by reducing its lower limit while retaining its \\r\\n    upper limit would help the Committee to convey its views regarding the \\r\\n    potential for a continuing but acceptable sluggishness in M2 growth \\r\\n    while leaving room for the possibility of faster M2 expansion should \\r\\n    changing circumstances foster diminishing strength in velocity. \\r\\n    Another member expressed a preference for narrowing the tentative \\r\\n    range by lowering only its upper limit as a means of signaling the \\r\\n    Committee\\'s intent to resist both inflationary and recessionary \\r\\n    developments. In light of the uncertainties that were involved, the \\r\\n    informational content of the aggregates probably had diminished and in \\r\\n    any event the Committee would need to continue to evaluate monetary \\r\\n    growth developments in the context of a careful assessment of a wide \\r\\n    variety of other financial, economic, and price developments. In this \\r\\n    connection, one member observed that the uncertainties were of such a \\r\\n    magnitude that, while plausible arguments could be made for a number \\r\\n    of different ranges, retention of the tentative ranges would be \\r\\n    appropriate in light of the Committee\\'s willingness to review the \\r\\n    ranges in the event that unanticipated developments were to unfold.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAll of the members agreed that it would be desirable to \\r\\n    retain the monitoring range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent that the \\r\\n    Committee had established on a provisional basis for the growth of \\r\\n    total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1993. The expansion in such debt \\r\\n    had not been damped by special forces to the same extent as the broad \\r\\n    monetary aggregates in 1992. Over the year ahead, growth in the \\r\\n    federal debt was likely to remain substantial, and the expansion of \\r\\n    debt in the nonfederal sectors was projected to accelerate somewhat \\r\\n    given the continued improvement in borrower balance sheets and an \\r\\n    anticipated increase in the willingness of financial institutions to \\r\\n    lend as the economy continued to expand. Nonetheless, in the context \\r\\n    of still cautious attitudes on the part of both borrowers and lenders, \\r\\n    the growth of nonfederal debt probably would remain below that of \\r\\n    nominal GDP in the year ahead.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all of the \\r\\n    members indicated that they favored or could accept a technical \\r\\n    downward adjustment of one-half percentage point in the tentative \\r\\n    ranges for the broader monetary aggregates for 1993 to rates of 2 to 6 \\r\\n    percent for M2 and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3. It was agreed that \\r\\n    there should be no change from the tentative range for total domestic \\r\\n    nonfinancial debt. In keeping with the Committee\\'s usual procedures \\r\\n    under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be reviewed at \\r\\n    midyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the growth and \\r\\n    velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial \\r\\n    developments. Accordingly, by unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1993 was approved by the Committee for inclusion in the \\r\\n    domestic policy directive:\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary \\r\\n      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In \\r\\n      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this \\r\\n      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of \\r\\n      2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, \\r\\n      measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth \\r\\n      quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are \\r\\n      likely to persist during the year. The monitoring \\r\\n      range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt \\r\\n      was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The \\r\\n      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be \\r\\n      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level \\r\\n      stability, movements in their velocities, and \\r\\n      developments in the economy and financial markets.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nTurning to policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all of the \\r\\n    members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in \\r\\n    reserve markets, and all indicated that they could accept a directive \\r\\n    that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the likely \\r\\n    direction of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. While there \\r\\n    was concern about the weakness in the monetary aggregates, the members \\r\\n    generally agreed that recent economic developments tended to reinforce \\r\\n    the view that monetary policy was on an appropriate course. The \\r\\n    economy seemed to be on a stronger growth track than earlier in the \\r\\n    expansion, and inflation remained quite subdued--only a bit above some \\r\\n    estimates of price stability--and likely to moderate further in coming \\r\\n    quarters in the view of most members. Some commented that a further \\r\\n    easing move at this juncture might well have adverse effects on \\r\\n    inflation sentiment and on interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets. A few referred to the recent firming in some \\r\\n    commodity prices and the consensus among private forecasters that \\r\\n    inflation could drift higher over the next few years. In the view of \\r\\n    one member, these developments might argue for a tilt in the directive \\r\\n    toward possible restraint, but they did not call for an immediate \\r\\n    tightening in reserve conditions.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nA staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested a resumption \\r\\n    of some growth in the broad measures of money later in the first \\r\\n    quarter but a decline in both M2 and M3 for the quarter as a whole. \\r\\n    While part of the declines appeared to reflect difficulties \\r\\n    with seasonal adjustments and the ebbing of special factors that \\r\\n    previously had boosted growth, the uncertainties surrounding the \\r\\n    behavior of these aggregates tended to reduce their role in current \\r\\n    monetary policy. Nevertheless, there was concern about the \\r\\n    persisting weakness in the broad aggregates, including the likelihood \\r\\n    that they would fall well short of the Committee\\'s new ranges over the \\r\\n    first part of the year. Some members also noted that the growth of \\r\\n    Ml, while still fairly robust in December and January, was markedly \\r\\n    below its pace over most of 1992. On the other hand, bank loans had \\r\\n    increased in recent months, and the weakness in the monetary \\r\\n    aggregates did not appear to reflect underlying softness in the \\r\\n    economy. In these circumstances, a number of members believed that \\r\\n    any effort to stimulate monetary growth under immediately prevailing \\r\\n    economic conditions and market expectations might well prove to be \\r\\n    counterproductive. An easing at this time could accelerate outflows \\r\\n    from interest-sensitive M2 assets if the easing were seen as signaling \\r\\n    a weakening of the System\\'s anti-inflationary resolve and were to \\r\\n    result in higher rates on intermediate- and long-term debt securities.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all of the \\r\\n    members indicated that they favored a directive that called for \\r\\n    maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. \\r\\n    They also noted their preference for, or acceptance of, a directive \\r\\n    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any \\r\\n    adjustment to policy over the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in \\r\\n    the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability \\r\\n    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to \\r\\n    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided \\r\\n    that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be \\r\\n    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions \\r\\n    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with \\r\\n    little change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period \\r\\n    from January through March.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBy unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was \\r\\n    authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to \\r\\n    execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the \\r\\n    following domestic policy directive:\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicates \\r\\n      that economic activity rose appreciably further in the \\r\\n      fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment \\r\\n      registered another small increase in December, and the \\r\\n      civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent. \\r\\n      Industrial production posted solid gains over the \\r\\n      closing months of the year. Retail sales were up \\r\\n      substantially in the fourth quarter, and residential \\r\\n      construction activity increased sharply. Indicators of \\r\\n      business fixed investment suggest a notable gain in \\r\\n      recent months, particularly for producers\\' durable \\r\\n      equipment. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit \\r\\n      narrowed slightly in October-November from its average \\r\\n      rate in the third quarter. Recent data on wages and \\r\\n      prices have been mixed but they continue to suggest on \\r\\n      balance a trend toward lower inflation.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nInterest rates have declined somewhat since the \\r\\n      Committee meeting on December 22. In foreign exchange \\r\\n      markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in \\r\\n      terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over \\r\\n      the intermeeting period.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nM2 appears to have contracted in December and \\r\\n      January, after expanding at a moderate pace over the \\r\\n      course of previous months; M3 is estimated to have \\r\\n      declined appreciably in both months. From the fourth \\r\\n      quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 \\r\\n      and M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of \\r\\n      the Committee\\'s annual ranges for 1992. Total domestic \\r\\n      nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded at the lower \\r\\n      end of the Committee\\'s monitoring range for the year.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary \\r\\n      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In \\r\\n      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this \\r\\n      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of \\r\\n      2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, \\r\\n      measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth \\r\\n      quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are \\r\\n      likely to persist during the year. The monitoring \\r\\n      range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt \\r\\n      was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The \\r\\n      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be \\r\\n      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level \\r\\n      stability, movements in their velocities, and \\r\\n      developments in the economy and financial markets.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn the implementation of policy for the immediate \\r\\n      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing \\r\\n      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the \\r\\n      context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for \\r\\n      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and \\r\\n      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, \\r\\n      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve \\r\\n      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be \\r\\n      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent \\r\\n      with little change in M2 and M3 over the period from \\r\\n      January to March.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAt this meeting the Committee discussed a preliminary report of a \\r\\n    subcommittee that had been established to examine various issues \\r\\n    relating to the release of information about Committee meetings and \\r\\n    decisions. All of the members agreed that the Committee should keep \\r\\n    the public as fully informed as possible about its monetary policy \\r\\n    decisions and their rationale. Such information could reduce \\r\\n    uncertainty about the stance of policy and about the factors the \\r\\n    Committee takes into account in reaching its decisions. However, \\r\\n    release of information should not be allowed to compromise the \\r\\n    overriding objective of making and implementing the best possible \\r\\n    decisions. In that regard, the Committee noted that its deliberative \\r\\n    process requires a free flow of ideas, including the ability to \\r\\n    advance or question hypotheses, to speculate on alternative outcomes, \\r\\n    and to change opinions in response to the views expressed by other \\r\\n    members. The members also needed to feel at liberty during meetings \\r\\n    to use a wide array of information that is obtained on a confidential \\r\\n    basis; at least some of that information would no longer be provided \\r\\n    to the Committee if there were a risk of public disclosure. Moreover, \\r\\n    the Committee wanted to give further consideration to the risk that \\r\\n    the adoption of a different schedule for releasing information about \\r\\n    policy decisions might have the effect, in difficult circumstances, of \\r\\n    reducing its willingness to make needed policy adjustments promptly. \\r\\n    No decisions were made at this meeting concerning various options for \\r\\n    apprising the public more fully or promptly of the Committee\\'s \\r\\n    actions, and it was understood that the subcommittee would continue to \\r\\n    study the matter.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be \\r\\n    held on Tuesday, March 23, 1993.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe meeting adjourned.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nSecretary\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nReturn to top\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nFOMC'"

              "'CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I’d like to briefly first review today’s policy decision.  I’ll then turn next to the Federal Open Market Committee’s quarterly economic projections also being released today, and I’ll place today’s policy decision in the context of the Committee’s projections and the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  I’ll then be glad to take your questions.  Throughout today’s briefing, my goal will be to reflect the consensus of the Committee, while taking note of the diversity of views as appropriate.  Of course, my remarks and interpretations are my own responsibility.   In its policy statement released earlier today, the Committee announced, first, that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings, and, second, that it will complete its planned purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  Of course, going forward, the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to meet the Federal Reserve’s mandate.   extended period.   The Committee made no change today in the target range of the federal funds rate, which remains at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an \\xa01 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL In conjunction with today’s meeting, FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  These projections are conditional on each participant’s individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the Committee’s objectives.  A table showing the projections has been distributed.  I’m going to focus today on the central tendency projections, which exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.   I call your attention, first, to the Committee’s longer-run projections, which represent participants’ assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and assuming no further shocks to the economy.  As the table shows, the longer-run projections for output growth have a central tendency of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, the same as in the January survey.  The longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 5.6 percent, somewhat narrower than in normal, or trend, rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run, respectively.  The economy’s longer-term rate of growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors, such as the rate of growth of the labor force and the speed of technological change, and it should be noted that estimates of these rates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision over time.   The central tendency of the longer-run projection for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  In contrast to economic growth and unemployment, the longer-run outlook for inflation is determined almost entirely by monetary policy; consequently, and given that these projections are based on the assumption that \\xa02 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL monetary policy is appropriate, these longer-run projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that Committee participants judge to be most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices.  At 1.7 to 2.0 percent, the “mandate-consistent” rate of inflation is greater than zero for a number of reasons.  Perhaps most important, attempting to maintain inflation at zero would increase the risk of experiencing an extended bout of deflation, or falling wages and prices, which in turn could lead employment to fall below its maximum sustainable level for a protracted period.  Hence, a goal of literally zero inflation is not consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, most central banks around the world aim to set inflation above zero, usually at about 2 percent.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  As indicated in today’s policy statement, the Committee sees the economic recovery as proceeding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and investment in equipment and software continue to expand, supporting the recovery, but nonresidential investment is still weak and the housing sector is depressed.  In the labor market, overall conditions continue to improve gradually.  For example, the unemployment rate moved down a bit further and payroll employment increased in March; new claims for unemployment insurance and indicators of hiring plans are also consistent with continued improvement.   Looking ahead, Committee participants expect a moderate recovery to continue through 2011, with some acceleration of growth projected for 2012 and 2013.  Specifically, as the table shows, participants’ projections for output growth have a central tendency of 3.1 to 3.3 percent for this year, but rise to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and about the same in 2013.  These projections are a little below those made by the Committee in January; the markdown of growth in 2011 in particular reflects the somewhat slower-than-anticipated pace of growth in the first quarter.   \\xa03 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL The outlook for above-trend growth is associated with a projected reduction in the unemployment rate, which is seen as edging down to 8.4 to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and then declining gradually to 6.8 to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, still well above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run projections for unemployment of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.  The projected decline in the unemployment rate is relatively slow largely because economic growth is projected to be only modestly above the trend growth rate of the economy.   On the inflation front, commodity prices have risen significantly recently, reflecting geopolitical developments and robust global demand, among other factors.  Increases in commodity prices are in turn boosting overall consumer inflation.  However, measures of underlying inflation, though having increased modestly in recent months, remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  Consequently, the Committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity prices to be transitory; as the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflation should decline toward its underlying level.  Specifically, participants’ projections for inflation have a central tendency of 2.1 to 2.8 percent for this year, noticeably higher than in the January projections, before declining to 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and then running at 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—both about the same as in January.   The Committee’s economic projections provide important context for understanding today’s policy action as well as the Committee’s general policy strategy.  Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag, so current policy actions must be taken with an eye to the likely future course of the economy.  Thus the Committee’s projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must guide its policy decisions.  The lags with which monetary policy affects the economy also imply that the Committee must focus on meeting its mandated objectives over the medium term, which can be as short as a year or two but may be longer, \\xa04 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL depending on how far the economy is initially from conditions of maximum employment and price stability.   To foster maximum employment, the Committee sets policy to try to achieve sufficient economic growth to return the unemployment rate over time to its long-term normal level.  At 8.8 percent, the current unemployment rate is elevated relative to that level, and progress toward more normal levels of unemployment seems likely to be slow.  The substantial ongoing slack in the labor market and the relatively slow pace of improvement remain important reasons that the Committee continues to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy.   In the medium term, the Committee also seeks to achieve a mandate-consistent inflation rate, which participants’ longer-term projections for inflation suggest is 2 percent or a bit less.  Although the recent surge in commodity prices has led inflation to pick up somewhat in the near term, the Committee continues to project inflation to return to mandate-consistent levels in the medium term, as I have discussed.  Consequently, the short-term increase in inflation has not prompted the Committee to tighten policy at this juncture.  Importantly, however, the Committee’s outlook for inflation is predicated on longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable; if households and firms continue to expect inflation to return to a mandate-consistent level in the medium term, then increased commodity prices are unlikely to induce significant second-round effects, in which inflation takes hold in noncommodity prices and in nominal wages.  Thus, besides monitoring inflation itself, the Committee will pay close attention to inflation expectations and to possible indications of second-round effects.   In providing extraordinary monetary policy accommodation in the aftermath of the crisis, the Committee has not only reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a very low level, but has also expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet substantially.  The Committee at this \\xa05 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL meeting continued its ongoing discussion of the available tools for removing policy accommodation, at such time as that should become appropriate.  The Committee remains confident that it has the tools that it needs to tighten monetary policy when it is determined that economic conditions warrant such a step.  And in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that normalization, we will carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.   Thank you again, and I’d be glad to take your questions.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we’re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter GDP number.  Your own projections for the year have been downgraded in this meeting.  How—first of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with monetary easing, even with payroll tax cuts?  And what’s behind this weaker forecast for 2011 GDP?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re correct.  We haven’t seen the GDP number yet.  But we, like most private-sector forecasters, are expecting a relatively weak number for the first quarter, maybe something a little under 2 percent.  Most of the factors that account for the slower growth in the first quarter appear to us to be transitory.  They include things like, for example, lower defense spending than was anticipated, which will presumably be made up in a later quarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick up again; and other factors like weather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may have a longer-term implication.  For example, construction, both residential and nonresidential, was very weak in the first quarter, and that may have some implications going forward.  So I would say that, roughly, that most of the slowdown in the first quarter is viewed by the Committee as being transitory.  That being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking \\xa06 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL into account factors like—like weaker construction and possibly just a bit less momentum in the economy.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, given what you know about the pace of the economy now, what is your best guess for how soon the Fed needs to begin to withdraw its extraordinary stimulus for the economy?  And could you also say what is your working definition of what “extended period” means from the purposes of the Fed statement?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, currently as the statement suggests, we are in a moderate recovery.  We’ll be looking very carefully, first, to see if that recovery is, indeed, sustainable, as we believe it is.  And we’ll also be looking very closely at the labor market.  We’ve seen improvement in the labor market in the first quarter relative to the latter part of last year, but we’d like to see continued improvement—more job creation going forward.  At the same time, we’re also looking very carefully at inflation, the other part of our mandate.  As I’ve noted, inflation—headline inflation—is at least temporarily higher, being driven by gasoline prices and some other commodity prices.  Our expectation is that—that inflation will come down towards a more normal level.  But we’ll be watching that carefully and also watching inflation expectations, which—you know, which are important that they remain well anchored if we’re going to see inflation remain under good control.  So to answer your question, I don’t know exactly how long it will be before a tightening process begins.  It’s going to depend obviously on the outlook and on those criteria which I suggested.  The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points:  “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.  Once those conditions are violated, or are we moving away from those conditions, that will be the time that we need to begin to tighten.  “Extended period” suggests that there would be a couple of meetings probably before—before \\xa07 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL action.  But, unfortunately, the reason we use this vaguer terminology is that we don’t know with certainty how quickly response will be required, and, therefore, we will do our best to communicate changes in our view as—but that will depend entirely on how the economy evolves.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, first, thanks for doing this.  This is a tremendous development.  There are critics who say that Fed policy has driven down the value of the dollar, and a lower value to the dollar reduces Americans’ standard of living.  How do you respond to the criticism that, essentially, Fed policy has reduced Americans’ standard of living?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, Steve.  First, I should start by saying that the Secretary of the Treasury, of course, is the spokesperson for U.S. policy on the dollar and Secretary Geithner had some words yesterday.  Let me just add to what he said, first, by saying that the Federal Reserve believes that a strong and stable dollar is both in American interest and in the interest of the global economy.  There are many factors that cause the dollar to move up and down over short periods of time.  But over the medium term, where our policy is aimed, we’re doing two things.  First, we are trying to maintain low and stable inflation by our definition of price stability by maintaining the purchasing value of the dollar, keeping inflation low.  That’s obviously good for the dollar.  The second thing we’re trying to accomplish is to get a stronger recovery and to achieve maximum employment.  And, again, a strong economy, growing, with attracting foreign capital, is going to be good for the dollar.  So in our view, if we do what’s needed to pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, that will also generate fundamentals that will help the dollar in the medium term.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman, one can’t help but noticing that it’s been unsuccessful so far. \\xa08 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the dollar—the dollar fluctuates.  One factor, for example, that has caused fluctuations that have been quite extreme during the crisis has been the safe-haven effect.  So, for example, during the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008, money flowed in to the Treasury market and drove up the value of the dollar quite substantially, reflecting the fact that U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world.  And a lot of what you’ve seen over the last couple of years is just the unwinding of that as the economy has strengthened and as uncertainty has—has been reduced.  But that’s indicative, I think, of the—of the high standing that the dollar still retains in the world.  Again, ultimately, the best thing we can do to create strong fundamentals for the dollar in the medium term is to, first, keep inflation low, which maintains the buying power of the dollar, and, second, to create a strong \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal.  Many Americans are upset that gasoline prices are rising so fast and that food prices are also going up.  Can you talk about whether there’s anything that the Fed can or should do about that?  And can you also comment or elaborate on the increase that we’ve seen in the inflation forecasts that the Fed put economy.   out today?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  Thanks, Jon.  So, first of all, gasoline prices obviously have risen quite significantly.  And we, of course, are watching that carefully, that higher gas prices are absolutely creating a great deal of financial hardship for a lot of people.  And gas, of course, is a necessity.  People need to drive to get to work.  So it’s obviously a very bad development to see gas prices rise so much.  Higher gas prices, higher oil prices also make economic developments less favorable.  On the one hand, obviously, the higher gas prices add to inflation.  On the other hand, by draining purchasing power from households, higher gas prices \\xa09 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL are also bad for the recovery.  They cause growth to decline as well.  So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.  Now, our—our interpretation of the increase in gas prices is the economist’s basic mantra of supply and demand.  On the one hand, we have a rapidly growing global economy.  Emerging market economies are growing very quickly, and their demand for commodities, including oil, is very, very strong.  Indeed, essentially all of the increase in the demand for oil in the last couple of years and the last decade has come from emerging market economies.  In the United States, our demand for oil—our imports have actually been going down over time.  So the demand is coming from a growing economy where we’ve seen about a 25 percent increase in emerging market output in the last—since before the crisis.  And on the supply side, as everybody knows who watches television, we’ve seen disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa, in Libya, and in other places that have constrained supply. That supply has not been made up, and that, in turn, has driven gas prices up quite significantly.  So, again, this is a very adverse development.  It accounts in the short run for the increase in our—pretty much almost all of the increase in our inflation forecast, at least in the very near term.  There’s not much the Federal Reserve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which is certainly not the right way to go.  After all, the Fed can’t create more oil.  We don’t control the growth rates of emerging market economies.  What we can do is basically try to keep higher gas prices from passing into other prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation, which would be much more difficult to extinguish.  Again, our view is that, most likely—of course, we don’t know for sure, but we’ll be watching carefully—our view is that gas prices will not continue to rise at the recent pace, and as they stabilize or even come down if the situation stabilizes in the Middle East, that that will provide some relief on the inflation front.  But we’ll have to watch it very carefully.   \\xa010 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Thank you.  Scott Lanman from Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, you’ve stated several times this year that the recovery won’t be fully established until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation.  First, has it become truly established yet?  And, if not, what’s your definition of a sustained period, and what’s your definition of stronger job creation?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I mentioned, we’ve made a lot of progress.  Last moderate.  And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.  Since then, we have seen a reasonable amount of payroll creation, job creation.  And that picked up in the most recent few months, together with the percent.  So the labor market is improving gradually, as we say in our statement.  And we’d just like to make sure that that is sustainable, and the longer it goes on, the more confident we are.  And, again, it is encouraging to see the improvement that we’ve seen in recent months.  That being said, the pace of improvement is still quite slow, and we are digging ourselves out of a very, very deep hole.  We are still something like 7 million-plus jobs below where we were before the crisis.  And so, clearly, the fact that we’re moving in the right direction, even though that’s encouraging, doesn’t mean that the labor market is in good shape.  Obviously, it’s not.  And we’re going to have to, you know, continue to watch and hope that we will get stronger and increasingly strong job creation going forward. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times.  Mr. Chairman, you say in your statement that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but a number of measures of inflation expectations have risen in recent months.  And it’s clear from your forecast that you expect headline inflation to run above core inflation for some period.  Is there anything that the \\xa011 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL Federal Reserve can do to prevent the public from maybe incorrectly assuming that a period of higher inflation is on its way as a result?  Thank you. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, the inflation expectations that we are concerned about are medium-term inflation expectations.  So we’ve seen, for example, in the financial markets, in the indexed bond market, for example, or in surveys like the Michigan survey, we’ve seen near-term inflation expectations rise fairly significantly, which is reasonable given higher commodity prices, higher gas prices.  But for the most part, although there’s been some movement here and there, for the most part, I think it’s fair to say that medium-term inflation expectations have not really moved very much, and they still indicate confidence that the Fed will ensure that inflation in the medium term will be close to what I’ve called the mandate-consistent level.  What can we do?  In the short run, we can communicate and try to make sure the public understands what our policy is attempting to do, to be clear what our objectives are and what steps we’re willing to take to meet those objectives.  Ultimately, if—if inflation persists or if inflation expectations begin to move, then there’s no substitute for action.  We would have—we would have to respond.  I think—while it is very, very important for us to try to help the economy create jobs and to support the recovery, I think every central banker understands that keeping inflation low and stable is absolutely essential to a successful economy.  And we will do what’s necessary to ensure that that happens.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, what will be the impact on the economic recovery, job creation, and rates on mortgages and other loans when the Fed ends its $600 billion bond-buying program?  And a quick follow-up is, Will the Fed continue—how long with the Fed continue to allow for reinvestments?  \\xa012 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  As I—as I’ve noted and as you’re all aware, we are—we are going to complete the program at the end of the second quarter, $600 billion.  We are going to do that pretty much without tapering.  We’re just going to let the purchases end.  Our view is that—based on past experience and based on our analysis—is that the end of the program is unlikely to have significant effects on financial markets or on the economy, the reason being that, first—just a simple point that we hoped we have telegraphed today—we hope we have communicated what we’re planning to do.  And the markets have well anticipated this step.  And you would expect that policy steps which are well anticipated by the market would have relatively small effects because whatever effects you’re going to have would have already been capitalized in the financial markets.  Secondly, we subscribe generally to what we call here the stock view of the effects of securities purchases, which—by which I mean that what matters primarily for interest rates, stock prices, and so on is not the pace of ongoing purchase, but rather the size of the portfolio that the Federal Reserve holds.  And so, when we complete the program, as you noted, we are going to continue to reinvest maturing securities, both Treasuries and MBS, and so the amount of securities that we hold will remain approximately constant.  Therefore, we shouldn’t expect any major effect of that.  Put another way, the amount of ease, monetary policy easing, should essentially remain constant going forward from—from June.  At some point, presumably early in our exit process, we will, I suspect, based on conversations we’ve been having around the FOMC table, it’s very likely that an early step would be to stop reinvesting all or part of the securities which are coming—which are maturing.  But take note that that step, although a relatively modest step, does constitute a policy tightening because it would be lowering the size of our balance sheet and, therefore, would be expected to essentially tighten financial conditions.  That being said, we therefore have to make that decision based on the \\xa013 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL outlook, based on our view of how sustainable the recovery is and what the condition—the situation is respect to inflation.  So we will base that decision on the evolving outlook. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Do you think it will be several months away?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It depends on the outlook.  The Committee will have to make a judgment.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Is it in the Fed’s power to reduce the rate of unemployment more quickly?  How would you do that, and why are you not doing it?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I should say, first of all, that, in terms of trying to help this economy stabilize and then recover, the Federal Reserve has undertaken extraordinary measures.  Those include, obviously, all the steps we took to stabilize the financial system during the crisis—again, many of which were extraordinary measures taken under extreme circumstances.  Even beyond the steps we took to stabilize the system, we have created new ways to ease monetary policy.  We’ve brought the federal funds rate target close to zero.  We have used forward guidance in our language to affect expectations of policy changes.  And, of course, as everyone knows, we have now been through two rounds of purchases of longer-term securities, which have seemed to have been effective in easing financial conditions and, therefore, providing support for recovery and for employment.  Going forward, we’ll have to continue to make judgments about whether additional steps are warranted.  But as we do so, we have to keep in mind that we do have a dual mandate, that we do have to worry about both the rate of growth but also the inflation rate.  And as I was indicating earlier, I think that—even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant.  And so we do have to make sure \\xa014 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that we are paying adequate attention to both sides of our mandate.  But clearly it is the case that we have done extraordinary things in order to try to help this economy recover. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  John Ydstie with NPR News.  Mr. Chairman, it’s the view of a lot of economists that the second round of quantitative easing hasn’t done much to help the economy.  What positive effects can you point to directly?  And if there are positive effects, can you really afford to end the program in June, with the unemployment rate still around 9 percent?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Well, first, I do believe that the second round of securities purchases was effective.  We saw that first in the financial markets.  The way monetary policy always works is by easing financial conditions.  And we saw increases in stock prices.  We saw reduced spreads in credit markets.  We saw reduced volatility.  We saw all the changes in financial markets and quite significant changes that one would expect if one was doing an ordinary easing of policy via a reduced federal funds rate.  And, indeed, we saw the same types of financial market responses in the first round, which began in March of 2009.  So we were able to get the financial easing that we were trying to get.  We did get very significant easing from this program.  You would expect, based on decades of experience, that easing financial conditions would lead to better economic conditions, and I think the evidence is consistent with that as well.  As I discussed in more detail in my Humphrey–Hawkins testimony in the beginning of March, between late August when I first indicated that the Federal Reserve was seriously considering this additional step and early this year, not only the Federal Reserve but many outside forecasters upgraded their forecasts.  And we saw—we saw strengthening labor that the second round of securities purchases was ineffective could only be validated if one thought that this—this step was a panacea, that it was going to solve all the problems and return \\xa015 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL us to full employment overnight.  We were very clear from the beginning that, while we thought this was an important step and that it was at an important time when we were all worried about a double dip and we were worried about deflation, we were very clear that this was not going to be a panacea, that it was only going to turn the economy in the right direction.  And, indeed, we published some analytics which gave job creation numbers which were significant but not—certainly not enough to completely solve the enormous jobs problem that we have.  So, again, relative to what we expected, anticipated, I think the program was successful.  Why not do more?  Again, this was similar to the question I received earlier.  The tradeoffs are getting—are getting less attractive at this point.  Inflation has gotten higher.  Inflation expectations are a bit higher.  It’s not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk.  And, in my view, if we’re going to have success in creating a long-run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we’ve got to keep inflation under control.  So we’ve got to look at both of those—both parts of the mandate as we—as we choose policy.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  I’m Luca Di Leo from Dow Jones.  Mr. Chairman, what’s the right response if high oil prices persist?  On the one hand, they push inflation higher.  On the other, they can hurt the economy by hitting spending.  In the current environment, what’s the best strategy?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we’re going to continue to—to see what happens.  Our anticipation is that oil prices will stabilize or tend to come down.  If that happens or if at least oil prices don’t increase significantly further, then inflation will—will come down, and we’ll have—we’ll be close to our medium-term objectives.  So, as we look at oil prices, you know, as you point out, we have to look at both sides of the situation.  I do think that one of the key things that we’ll be looking at will be inflation expectations because, if medium-term \\xa016 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL inflation expectations remain well anchored and stable so that firms are not passing on—at least on an ongoing, sustained basis—these higher costs into broader prices, into creating a broader inflation in the economy, as long as inflation expectations are well—are well stabilized, that won’t happen, then we’ll feel more comfortable just watching and waiting and seeing how things evolve.  Again, if we fear that inflation expectations look like they’re becoming less anchored, we would have to respond to that.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report.  You’ve talked a lot in the past about the problem of long-term unemployment.  Can the Fed effectively reduce long-term unemployment?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, you’re absolutely right.  Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.  Currently something like 45 percent of all the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or longer.  And we know the consequences of that can be very distressing because people who are out of work for a long time, their skills tend to atrophy—they lose contacts with the labor market, with other people working, the networks that they have built up.  And we saw in the European experience, for example, in the ’80s and ’90s, that a period of high unemployment with very long-term unemployment spells can actually lead unemployment to remain very high for a protracted period.  So it is a very significant concern.  And it’s one of the reasons that—that the Federal Reserve has been so aggressive.  By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.  So that’s part of the reason that we have been as aggressive as we have.  As the situation drags on and as the long-term unemployed lose skills and lose contact with the labor \\xa017 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL of the scope of monetary policy.  At that point, job training, education, and other types of interventions would probably be more effective than monetary policy. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Could I just follow up?  So a lot of the long-term unemployment that we’re seeing now, do you think that’s out of the scope of what the Fed can do?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, indirectly, of course, if—to the extent that we can help the economy recover and help job creation proceed, then some of the people who get jobs will be those who’ve been out of work for a long time.  That being said, we don’t have any tools for targeting long-term unemployment specifically.  We just—can just try to make the labor \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Peter Barnes, of Fox Business Network, Mr. Chairman.  Last week, Standard & Poor’s put the United States’ debt on a negative watch for the very first time ever.  What is your reaction to that?  And are you concerned, are you worried that the United States is going to lose its triple-A credit rating?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, in one sense, S&P’s action didn’t really tell us anything because everybody who reads the newspaper knows that the United States has a very serious long-term fiscal problem.  That being said, I’m hopeful that this event will provide at least one more incentive for Congress and the Administration to—to address this problem.  I think it’s the most important economic problem, at least in the longer term, that the United States faces.  We currently have a fiscal deficit which is simply not sustainable over the longer term.  And if it’s not the addressed, it will have significant consequences for financial stability, for economic growth, and for our standard of living.  It is encouraging that we are seeing efforts on both sides of the aisle to think about this issue from a long-run perspective.  It’s not a problem \\xa018 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL that can be solved by making changes only for the next six months.  It’s really a long-run issue.  We’re still a long way from a solution, obviously.  But it is, I think, of the highest importance that our political leaders address this very difficult problem as quickly and as effectively as they can.  And to the extent that the S&P action goads a response, I think that’s—that’s constructive.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, John Berry.  In the past, there have been times when fiscal policy has tightened, and the Federal Reserve has chosen to ease its policy in response partly to that, given whatever the circumstances in the economy were at the time.  Congress appears intent at this point in cutting spending significantly; it might restrain the economy as it appears to be doing in Britain where they’re following a similar path.  Is there anything the Fed can do or should do if, indeed, there are large budget cuts sometime in the next 18 months?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first let me say that, addressing the fiscal deficit, particularly the long-run unsustainable deficit, is a top priority.  And nothing I would want to say would be—should be construed as saying that I think it’s anything other than a top priority.  It’s very, very important that our leaders address this—address this issue.  I would also say that the cuts that have been made so far don’t seem to us to have very significant consequences for short-term economic activity.  Now, my preference in terms of addressing the—the long-term deficit is to take a long-term perspective.  It’s a long-term problem.  If Congress and the Administration are able to make credible commitments to cutting programs or in any way changing the fiscal profile going forward over a long period of time, that is the most constructive way to address what is, in fact, a long-run problem.  If the changes are focused entirely on the short run, then they might have some consequences for growth.  And in that case, the Federal Reserve, which is, as always, going to try to set monetary policy to meet our mandate, would take those into \\xa019 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL account appropriately.  But so far, I’ve not seen any fiscal changes that have really changed our near-term outlook. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m Toshi Ogata with the Asahi Shimbun, Japanese newspaper.  I’d like to ask about uncertainties in the global economy or downside risks.  In minutes from the March meeting, you—the Committee noted that the development in Japan increased uncertainties.  So what’s the latest assessment on those risks or uncertainties such as tragedy in Japan or crisis in Europe and uprising in the Middle East?  And what would be the impact of those on the U.S. economy and the world economy?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, one of the things that our projections include—you know, we’re only producing the forecast today—with our minutes in three weeks, we’ll include the full detailed projections as we normally do.  One of the things that we include is the views of the participants on the amount of uncertainty there is in the forecast going forward.  And I think I can say, without too much fear of giving away the secret, that FOMC participants do see quite a bit of uncertainty in the world going forward, and a lot of that uncertainty is coming from global factors.  I’ve already talked about Middle Eastern–North Africa developments which have affected oil prices, conditions in emerging markets which have affected commodity prices and other things.  The European situation continues, and we’re watching that very carefully.  Now, obviously, you asked about Japan.  Let me first say, you know, that I’ve had a lot of contact with my Japanese counterparts, central bank Governor Shirakawa and other people in the Japanese government.  We collaborated with them on the foreign exchange intervention, as you know.  And we are very admiring of the courage of the Japanese people in responding to these situations and of—the central bank of Japan has done, I think, a good job in providing liquidity and helping to stabilize financial markets in what are very, very significant disturbances to the economy.  The \\xa020 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL implications for Japan have been discussed at some length, and I think Governor Shirakawa recently talked about them.  In the near term, there will probably be a decline in Japanese output, reflecting the destruction, reflecting electricity problems, et cetera.  We believe that will be relatively temporary and that the economy will start to come back.  But, of course, this is a major blow, and it will take a lot of effort on the part of the Japanese people to restore the economy and to recover from the damage that was done by the—by the tragedy.  For the United States, we are looking at this very carefully.  Thus far, the main impact of the Japanese situation on the U.S. economy has been through supply chains.  We’ve noted some automobile companies, for example, that have had difficulty getting certain components which are manufactured mostly or entirely in Japan.  And that has led a number of companies to announce that they would restrain production for a time.  So there may be some moderate effect on—on the U.S. economy.  But we expect it to be moderate and to be temporary.  Again, the most important issue here is—is the recovery of Japan, and our good wishes go out to the Japanese people and their efforts to overcome the adversity that they’re facing.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, you have often stressed, as indeed you did again today, the importance of keeping inflation expectations low and stable to keep inflation itself under control.  But irrespective of inflationary expectations or psychology, isn’t it possible that the Fed’s policies could be providing the monetary tinder for inflation the longer they continue?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we—we view our monetary policies as being not that different from ordinary monetary policy.  I mean, it’s true that we’ve used some different tools.  But those tools are operating through financial conditions, and we have a lot of experience understanding how financial conditions—changes in interest rates, changes in stock prices, and so on—how they affect the economy, including both growth and inflation.  So we are monitoring \\xa021 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL the state of the economy, watching the evolving outlook.  And our intention, as is always the case, is to tighten policy at the appropriate time to ensure that inflation remains well controlled, that we meet that part of our mandate, while doing the best we can to ensure also that we have a stable economy and a sustainable recovery in the labor market.  So the problem is the same one that central banks always face, which is choosing the appropriate path of tightening at the appropriate stage of the recovery.  It’s difficult to get it exactly right, but we have a lot of experience in terms of what are the considerations and the economics that underlie those the recovery to continue and allow the economy to return to a more normal configuration, at the same time keeping inflation low and stable.   \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Hughes Honore, Agence France-Presse.  Many of the commercial partners of the United States are very concerned about the evolution of your foreign exchange rate.  If in one hypothetical case the dollar would sink to a terrible level which would harm very much the U.S. economy and the prospect for the global economy because it affects the confidence of so many people, would you consider changing your monetary policy in accordance to that threat?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I said earlier, we do believe that a strong and stable dollar is in the interest of the United States and is in the interest of the global economy.  Our view is that the best thing we can do for the dollar is, first, to keep the purchasing power of the dollar strong by keeping inflation low and by creating a stronger economy through—through policies which support the recovery and, therefore, cause more capital inflows to the United States.  So those are the kinds of policies I think that in the medium term will create the conditions for an appropriate and healthy level of the dollar.  So I don’t think I really want to address a hypothetical which I really don’t anticipate, because I think that the policies that we are \\xa022 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL undertaking, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations, will lead to a strong and stable dollar in the medium term.   facing Congress.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, Anthony Mason, CBS.  This is that rare news conference that actually makes news before it happens.  Can you talk a little bit about your decision to take this historic step of holding a news conference after a Fed meeting—why you chose to do it; what anxieties you may have had about doing it; and how, say, facing the media compares to \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, mom [laughing].  Well, the Federal Reserve has been looking for ways to increase its transparency now for many years, and we’ve made a lot of progress.  It used to be that the mystique of central banking was all about not letting anybody know what you were doing.  As recently as 1994, the Federal Reserve didn’t even tell the public when it changed the target for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have taken a number of steps.  A statement, which includes a vote.  We have—we produce very detailed minutes which are released only three weeks after the meeting, which is essentially a production lag.  We now provide quarterly projections, including long-run objectives as well as near-term outlook.  We have substantial means of communicating through speeches, testimony, and the like.  And so we have become, I think, a very—a very transparent central bank.  That being said, we had a subcommittee headed by the Vice Chair of the Board, Janet Yellen, looking for yet additional steps to take to provide additional transparency and accountability.  And the press conference was—came right to the top, because this is an area, first of all, where global central bank practice includes now—many central banks do use press conferences, and we have some experience with them.  And, secondly, it does provide a chance for the Chairman, in this case, to provide some additional color and context for both—in this case both the meeting and the projections that are \\xa023 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL being made by the Committee.  So we thought it was a natural next step.  We’re not done.  We’re continuing to look for additional things that we can do to be more transparent and more accountable.  But we think this is the right way to go.  And I personally have always been a big believer in providing as much information as you can to help the public understand what you’re doing, to help the markets understand what you’re doing, and to be accountable to the public for what you’re doing.  Now, of course, the Fed didn’t do this for a long time.  And I think the counterargument has always been that, if there was a risk, that the Chairman speaking might create unnecessary volatility in financial markets or may not be necessary, given all the other sources of—of information that come out of the Federal Reserve.  It was our judgment, after thinking about this for some time, that at this point, the additional benefits from more information, more transparency, meeting the press directly, outweigh some of these—some of these risks.  And I think, over time, you know, we’ll experiment to try to make sure that this is as effective a venue as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTION.  Mr. Chairman, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote a book looking at 800 years of financial history and discovered that, when you have a financial crisis, it takes a lot longer for the economy to recover.  Are people expecting too much from the Federal Reserve in terms of helping the economy recover?  And has that complicated your monetary policymaking?  \\r\\n\\r\\n[SECTION]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me just say, first, that Ken Rogoff was a graduate school classmate of mine, so I’ve known him for a long time.  I’ve even played chess against him, which was a big mistake.  And I enjoyed that book very much.  I thought it was very informative.  And as you say, it makes a point that, as an historical matter, that recoveries following financial crises tend to be relatively slow.  Now, what the book didn’t really do, though, was given a full explanation of why that’s the case.  Certainly, part of it has to do with \\xa024 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL the problems in credit markets, and my own research when I was in academia focused a great deal on the effects of problems in credit markets on recoveries.  Other aspects would include the effects of credit problems on areas like housing and so on.  And we’re seeing all that, of course, in our economy.  But that said, another possible explanation for the slow recovery from financial crises might be that policy responses were not adequate, that they—that the recapitalization of the banking system, the restoration of credit flows, and monetary and fiscal policies were not sufficient to get—to get as quick a recovery as might otherwise have been possible.  And so, you know, we haven’t allowed that historical fact to dissuade us from doing all we can to support a strong recovery.  That being said, it is a relatively slow recovery, and you can identify reasons for that.  Credit factors are one.  Another very important factor is that, you know, this was triggered by a bubble in the housing market, and the housing market remains very weak.  And under normal circumstances, construction, both residential and nonresidential, would be a big part of the recovery process.  And so there are a number of factors, and now we’re seeing high oil prices and other things.  There are a number of factors which are holding—which are holding the recovery back.  So there are good reasons for why the recovery is slower than we would like.  At the same time, it’s very hard to blame the American public for being impatient.  Conditions are far from where they—where we would like them to be.  The combination of high unemployment, high gas prices, and high foreclosure rates is a terrible combination.  A lot of people are having a very tough time.  So I can certainly understand why people are impatient.  And I guess the only thing I can say is that, while the recovery process looks likely to continue to be a relatively moderate one compared to the depth of the—of the recession, I do think that the pace will pick up over time.  And I am very confident that, in the long run, that the U.S. will return to being the most productive—one of the fastest growing and dynamic economies in the \\xa025 of 26\\xa0\\x0cApril 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL world.  And it hasn’t lost any of the basic characteristics that made it the preeminent economy in the world before the crisis, and I think we’ll return to that status as we recover.   Thank you very much, and thank you for coming.    \\xa026 of 26'"

              "'Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nBank supervision in a world economy\\r\\nAt the International Conference of Banking Supervisors, Stockholm, Sweden\\r\\nJune 13, 1996\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nI am honored to present the William Taylor Memorial\\r\\n     Lecture to such a distinguished group of senior bank supervisors\\r\\n     from around the world.  I am especially delighted to have with us\\r\\n     Bill\\'s wife, Sharon, and daughter, Claire.  This visit gives them\\r\\n     the opportunity to meet more of Bill\\'s colleagues and to\\r\\n     appreciate, once again, the great importance of the work he did.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThose of you who had the opportunity to know Bill can\\r\\n     recall him as a dedicated bank supervisor and an outstanding\\r\\n     public servant.  We in the United States were certainly fortunate\\r\\n     to have had him lead our bank supervisory functions at the\\r\\n     Federal Reserve and the FDIC while the U.S. banking system was\\r\\n     experiencing quite difficult times.  To me, no individual\\r\\n     displayed the characteristics necessary for a successful senior\\r\\n     bank supervisor better than Bill Taylor.  Well known for this\\r\\n     integrity, tenacity, and professional dedication, Bill demanded\\r\\n     the best from himself and from those around him.  He understood\\r\\n     that a safe and sound banking system was essential to a healthy\\r\\n     market system, and he was committed to maintaining such a system.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nHis contributions extended outside the United States\\r\\n     and into the efforts of the Basle Committee on Banking\\r\\n     Supervision and beyond.  Indeed, he--as much as anyone--\\r\\n     recognized that the changes occurring in our international\\r\\n     banking system increased the importance of supervisors from\\r\\n     around the world communicating and working together.  It is most\\r\\n     fitting, therefore, that we remember him at this conference.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nA Period of Change\\n\\r\\n               The dual themes of this year\\'s conference of cross-\\r\\n     border banking and qualitative supervision are highly relevant to\\r\\n     our responsibilities as bank supervisors in a world economy that\\r\\n     is becoming increasingly integrated and complex.  Banking has\\r\\n     become more sophisticated; the volume of transactions has\\r\\n     multiplied; and competitive pressures have grown.  These\\r\\n     developments reflect the increased efficiency of financial\\r\\n     markets worldwide, which have helped to bring about expanded\\r\\n     international trade and economic growth.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nHowever, by strengthening the interdependencies among\\r\\n     markets and market participants, they may also have increased the\\r\\n     potential for significant, adverse events to spread quickly to\\r\\n     other markets.  As bank supervisors, we must deal with both the\\r\\n     positive and the potentially negative effects of rapid innovation\\r\\n     and change.  We should also take the opportunity that change\\r\\n     provides to promote sound risk management practices within our\\r\\n     banking systems.  Meeting these challenges will be a daunting\\r\\n     task.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nDuring my comments this evening I will suggest ways\\r\\n     supervisors can address these challenges and prepare for\\r\\n     undoubtedly greater changes in the years to come.  First, though,\\r\\n     I would like to discuss the interaction of governments and\\r\\n     central banks with private commercial banks in free economies in\\r\\n     terms of risk sharing.  By articulating and understanding that\\r\\n     relationship, we may have a better framework for considering how\\r\\n     to supervise and regulate our financial institutions.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nA Leveraged Banking System\\n         In addressing these issues it is important to remember\\r\\n     that many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive\\r\\n     from their willingness to take risks and from their use of a\\r\\n     relatively high degree of financial leverage.  Through leverage,\\r\\n     in the form principally of taking deposits, banks perform a\\r\\n     critical role in the financial intermediation process, providing\\r\\n     savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a\\r\\n     greater range of sources of credit, thereby facilitating a more\\r\\n     efficient allocation of resources and contributing importantly to\\r\\n     greater economic growth.  Indeed, it was the evident value of\\r\\n     intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of\\r\\n     our financial systems from the earliest times--certainly since\\r\\n     Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited gold\\r\\n     was feasible and profitable.  Stockholm, itself, recognized the\\r\\n     value of intermediation with the founding of the Riksbank more\\r\\n     than 300 years ago as a private institution.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nOf course, this same leverage and risk-taking also\\r\\n     greatly increases the possibility of bank failure.  Indeed,\\r\\n     without leverage, losses from risk-taking would be absorbed by\\r\\n     the bank\\'s owners, virtually eliminating the chance that the bank\\r\\n     would be unable to meet its obligations in a \"failure\".  Some\\r\\n     failures can be of a bank\\'s own making, resulting, for example,\\r\\n     from poor credit judgements.  For the most part, these failures\\r\\n     are a normal and important part of the market process and provide\\r\\n     discipline and information to other participants regarding the\\r\\n     level of business risks.  Other failures, can result from, and\\r\\n     contribute to, the rare episodes of severe economic or market\\r\\n     turmoil that affects broad segments of an economy and is not the\\r\\n     consequence of the imprudence of individual banks.  Because of\\r\\n     important roles banks and other financial intermediaries play in\\r\\n     our financial systems, such failures could have large ripple\\r\\n     effects that spread throughout business and financial markets at\\r\\n     great costs.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Distribution of Risks\\n        Over time, societies concluded that leverage and\\r\\n     intermediation were essential to economic performance, but also\\r\\n     that some bank failures could have unacceptable economic costs.\\r\\n     In response, central banks were created and were accorded new\\r\\n     responsibilities, and what we now call prudential regulation\\r\\n     evolved.  In the United States, these initiatives took the shape\\r\\n     of the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 after several\\r\\n     financial panics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and\\r\\n     of federal deposit insurance and a broadened role for bank\\r\\n     supervisors in the 1930\\'s.  While the responses in other\\r\\n     countries were often less overt, they were generally still\\r\\n     significant in their effects.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThis expanded role of governments, central banks, and\\r\\n     bank supervisors implies a complex approach to managing and even\\r\\n     sharing the risks of failure between governments and privately\\r\\n     owned banks.  Some of what central banks do might be termed\\r\\n     \"shaping\" or reducing some kinds of risks, primarily by providing\\r\\n     liquidity in certain situations to reduce the odds of extreme\\r\\n     market outcomes, in which uncertainty feeds market panics.\\r\\n     Traditionally this was accomplished by making discount or Lombard\\r\\n     facilities available, so that depositories could turn illiquid\\r\\n     assets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled market\\r\\n     conditions by selling such assets or calling loans.  Similarly,\\r\\n     open market operations, in situations like that which followed\\r\\n     the 1987 stock market crash, satisfy increased needs for\\r\\n     liquidity that otherwise could feed cumulative, self-reinforcing,\\r\\n     contractions across many financial markets.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBut guarding against systemic problems also has\\r\\n     involved, on very rare occasions, an element of more overt risk-\\r\\n     sharing, in which the government--or more accurately the\\r\\n     taxpayer--is potentially asked to bear some of the cost of\\r\\n     failure.  Activating such risk sharing quite appropriately occurs\\r\\n     at most maybe two or three times a century.  The willingness to\\r\\n     do so arises from society\\'s judgment that some bank failures may\\r\\n     have serious adverse effects on the entire economy and that\\r\\n     requiring banks to carry enough capital to avoid any risk of\\r\\n     failure under any circumstances itself would have unacceptable\\r\\n     costs in terms of reduced intermediation.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIf banks had to absorb all financial risk, then the\\r\\n     degree to which they could leverage, of necessity, would be\\r\\n     limited, and their contribution to economic growth, modest.\\r\\n     Risk-sharing encourages leverage and intermediation.  Eliminating\\r\\n     risk-sharing and asking banks to remove the possibility of\\r\\n     failure would lead to a much smaller banking system.  To attract,\\r\\n     or at least retain equity capital, a private financial\\r\\n     institution must earn at a minimum the overall economy\\'s rate of\\r\\n     return, adjusted for risk.  The rate of return banks would need\\r\\n     in order to compete for a large amount of extra equity capital\\r\\n     would seriously constrain the assets they could hold.  In their\\r\\n     management of market or credit risk, well-run banks  carefully\\r\\n     consider potential losses from most possible market outcomes, and\\r\\n     they hold sufficient capital to protect themselves from all but\\r\\n     the most extreme situations.  But banks and other private\\r\\n     businesses recognize that to be safe against all possible risks\\r\\n     implies a level of capital on which it would be difficult, if not\\r\\n     impossible, to earn a competitive rate of return.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nOn the other hand, if central banks or governments\\r\\n     effectively insulate private institutions from the largest\\r\\n     potential losses, however incurred, increased laxity could be\\r\\n     costly to society as well.  Leverage would escalate to the outer\\r\\n     edge of prudence, if not beyond.  Lenders to banks (as well as\\r\\n     their owners or managers) would learn to anticipate central bank\\r\\n     or government intervention and would become less responsible,\\r\\n     perhaps reckless, in their practices.  Such laxity would hold the\\r\\n     potential of a major call on taxpayers.  And central banks would\\r\\n     risk inflationary instabilities from excess money creation if\\r\\n     they acted too readily and too often to head off possible market\\r\\n     turmoil.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn practice, the policy choice of how much, if any, of\\r\\n     the extreme market risk that government authorities should absorb\\r\\n     is fraught with many complexities.  Yet we central bankers make\\r\\n     this decision every day, either explicitly or by default.\\r\\n     Moreover, we can never know for sure whether the decisions we\\r\\n     made were appropriate.  The question, though, is not whether our\\r\\n     actions to support entire financial systems or to require major\\r\\n     changes at specific institutions are seen to have been necessary\\r\\n     in retrospect.  The absence of a fire does not mean that we\\r\\n     should not have paid for fire insurance.  Rather, the question is\\r\\n     whether, ex ante, the probability of a systemic collapse was\\r\\n     sufficient to warrant intervention.  Often, we cannot wait to see\\r\\n     whether, in hindsight, the problem will be judged to have been an\\r\\n     isolated event and largely benign.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nSupervisory Approach\\n\\r\\n               Thus, governments have been given certain\\r\\n     responsibilities related to their banking and financial systems\\r\\n     that must be balanced.  We have the responsibility to prevent\\r\\n     major financial market disruptions through development and\\r\\n     enforcement of prudent regulatory standards and, if necessary in\\r\\n     rare circum- stances, through direct intervention in market\\r\\n     events.  But we also have the responsibility to assure that\\r\\n     private sector institutions have the capacity to take prudent and\\r\\n     appropriate risks, even though such risks will sometimes result\\r\\n     in bank losses or even bank failures.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nProviding institutions with the flexibility that may\\r\\n     lead to failure is as important as permitting them the\\r\\n     opportunity to succeed.  By its nature, all business investment\\r\\n     is risky.  The role of banks to assist in the financing of\\r\\n     such risk thus implies the taking of risk by the bank itself.\\r\\n     Indeed, this is the economic role of banking in a market economy.\\r\\n     The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk, but to\\r\\n     manage it in a prudent manner.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nOur goal as supervisors, therefore, should not be to\\r\\n     prevent all bank failures, but to maintain sufficient prudential\\r\\n     standards so that banking problems do not become widespread.  We\\r\\n     try to achieve the proper balance through official regulations,\\r\\n     formal and informal supervisory policies and procedures.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nTo some extent, we do this over time by signalling to\\r\\n     the market, through our actions, the kinds of circumstances in\\r\\n     which we might be willing to inter- vene to quell financial\\r\\n     turmoil, and conversely, what levels of difficulties we expect\\r\\n     private institutions to resolve by themselves.  The market, then,\\r\\n     responds by adjusting the cost of capital to banks.  Throughout\\r\\n     most of this century, we have made our decisions largely in a\\r\\n     domestic context.  However, in recent decades that situation has\\r\\n     changed markedly for many countries and is rapidly changing for\\r\\n     all.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nWith financial instruments and markets becoming more\\r\\n     complex and closely linked, it is essential that bank supervisors\\r\\n     around the globe get to know and trust one another and\\r\\n     communicate openly, as necessary, when banking problems and\\r\\n     potential crises emerge.  In recognition of such common\\r\\n     interests, major industrial countries have worked together for\\r\\n     years through the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision.\\r\\n     Conferences like this one also clearly help advance the goal of\\r\\n     interaction.  International coordinating and educational efforts\\r\\n     doubtless also help supervisors cope with the growing complexity\\r\\n     of supervisory matters by providing them with a forum for dealing\\r\\n     with issues of mutual interest and concern.  The Caribbean\\r\\n     Banking Supervisors Group, the SEANZA Forum of Banking\\r\\n     Supervisors, and other regional associations of bank supervisors\\r\\n     in the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere help to move us in the\\r\\n     right direction.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nWe have also made--and continue to make--significant\\r\\n     progress in developing prudent international supervisory\\r\\n     standards that are both quantitative and qualitative in nature.\\r\\n     Bill Taylor played a critical role in crafting and negotiating\\r\\n     the Basle Accord of 1988 for credit risk that helped greatly to\\r\\n     strengthen capital standards worldwide and to provide a more\\r\\n     equitable basis for international competition.  More recently,\\r\\n     the internal models approach for measuring market risks in\\r\\n     trading activities, adopted by the Basle Committee late last\\r\\n     year, builds upon that framework and may illustrate how\\r\\n     supervisory rules and practices can evolve.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAs financial markets change, supervision must be\\r\\n     prepared to adjust.  We have to adapt continuously to changing\\r\\n     technologies, changing bank practices and changing market forces.\\r\\n     Supervision is an ever evolving process.  We must be careful,\\r\\n     however, not to alter our modalities too often for fear of\\r\\n     creating supervisory uncertainty.  To maintain a proper balance\\r\\n     in the years ahead will be one of our greatest challenges.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe decision to craft a bank\\'s capital requirements for\\r\\n     trading activities around accepted and verifiable internal risk\\r\\n     measures was an important step in the supervision and regulation\\r\\n     of large, internationally active banks.  It is all the more\\r\\n     noteworthy because it recognizes the importance of both\\r\\n     quantitative and qualitative criteria in the measurement and\\r\\n     management of trading risks.  As risk management techniques\\r\\n     evolve for other bank activities, supervisors will need to\\r\\n     understand the new procedures and how they affect overall banking\\r\\n     risks.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nTime and again, though, events are demonstrating that\\r\\n     despite the complexity of transactions and the alleged\\r\\n     sophistication of management systems, it is poor qualitative\\r\\n     factors--that is, the lack of basic policies and controls--that\\r\\n     so often undermine banks.  Fortunately, in many cases, the\\r\\n     technology that has enabled institutions to design complex new\\r\\n     products also provides the techniques with which the resulting\\r\\n     risks can be identified, measured, and controlled.  Management\\r\\n     also must have the knowledge and motivation to employ these\\r\\n     techniques to ensure that the risks are adequately contained.  We\\r\\n     must never forget that no matter how technologically complex our\\r\\n     supervisory systems become, the basic unit of supervision on\\r\\n     which all else rests remains the human judgment of the degree of\\r\\n     risk on a specific loan, based on the creditworthiness and\\r\\n     character of a borrower.  If those credit judgments are\\r\\n     persistently flawed, no degree of complexity of supposed risk\\r\\n     dispersion or elegance of credit models will help.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nAs the Barings and other episodes illustrate, proper\\r\\n     controls include such basic elements as adequate management\\r\\n     oversight and separation of duties.  Those of us who supervise\\r\\n     banks with worldwide operations must recognize that, with today\\'s\\r\\n     telecommunications, management must extend its policies,\\r\\n     procedures, and controls to all offices that have the ability to\\r\\n     take risks.  In this respect, coordination and cooperation\\r\\n     between home and host countries become not only important, but\\r\\n     essential in maintaining financially sound institutions and\\r\\n     financial markets.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nWithin the United States, the Federal Reserve and other\\r\\n     bank supervisors are placing growing importance on a bank\\'s risk\\r\\n     management process and are strengthening our supervisory\\r\\n     procedures, where necessary, to assist examiners in identifying\\r\\n     management weaknesses and strengths.  We are also working to\\r\\n     develop supervisory tools and techniques that utilize available\\r\\n     technology and that help supervisors perform their duties with\\r\\n     less disruption to banks.  These improvements range from software\\r\\n     designed to download data about a bank\\'s loan portfolio to an\\r\\n     examiner\\'s personal computer, to simply more thoughtful reviews\\r\\n     of internal management reports.  Such automation enhancements\\r\\n     will permit examiners, themselves, to analyze more efficiently\\r\\n     the various concentrations within loan or investment portfolios\\r\\n     and, therefore, help them to identify the underlying risks and\\r\\n     discuss those risks with bank management.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nCountries in which supervisors conduct on-site\\r\\n     examinations or otherwise review specific loans or loan\\r\\n     portfolios may find such technology particularly useful.  Within\\r\\n     the United States, the growing volume and complexity of\\r\\n     transactions, particularly at the largest institutions, is\\r\\n     requiring such productivity enhancements and other modifications\\r\\n     to our supervisory procedures.  For example, rather than\\r\\n     evaluate a high percentage of a bank\\'s loans and investment\\r\\n     products by reviewing individual transactions, we will\\r\\n     increasingly seek to ensure that the management process itself is\\r\\n     sound, and that adequate policies and controls exist.  While\\r\\n     still important, the amount of transaction testing, especially at\\r\\n     large banks, will decline.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nHowever, supervisors everywhere should expect bank\\r\\n     boards of directors and senior managements to perform their\\r\\n     leadership and oversight roles.  By themselves supervisors cannot\\r\\n     expect to detect or prevent every unsound practice, nor to ensure\\r\\n     that all weak management processes are improved.  We can expect\\r\\n     our banking systems to be sound only by ensuring that directors\\r\\n     and managers provide guidance regarding their appetite for risk;\\r\\n     that they bring to the bank, personnel with the integrity and\\r\\n     skills to do the job; and that they monitor compliance with their\\r\\n     own directives.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nEncouraging and promoting sound qualitative risk\\r\\n     management and internal controls has been and should remain a\\r\\n     high priority of bank supervisors. Indeed, it is as important, in\\r\\n     my view, as the development of quantitative prudential standards.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\r\\n        Thus, despite all the changes and innovations, commercial\\r\\n     banking remains a business largely of extending credit and\\r\\n     managing the related risks.  To prosper, bankers must be risk-\\r\\n     takers, but risk-takers to an appropriate degree.  Banking is\\r\\n     special in all of our countries because of its role in financial\\r\\n     intermediation.  Accordingly, the industry has been given\\r\\n     important privileges, including the direct or implicit support of\\r\\n     a national safety net in most countries that effectively protects\\r\\n     it from the most severe economic events.  If relied on too\\r\\n     heavily, however, that safety net can be abused by banks, which\\r\\n     then become undercapitalized and too willing to take on\\r\\n     inappropriate risk.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn the decades ahead, supervisors will have to adjust\\r\\n     to growing technologies and increasingly sophisticated markets.\\r\\n     A generation ago a month-old bank balance sheet was a reasonable\\r\\n     approximation of the current state of an institution.  Today, for\\r\\n     some banks, day-old balance sheets are on the edge of\\r\\n     obsolescence.  In the 21st century that will be true of most\\r\\n     banks.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nFuture supervision will of necessity have to rely far\\r\\n     more on a bank\\'s risk management information system to protect\\r\\n     against loss.  We supervisors will be appreciably more involved\\r\\n     in evaluating individual bank risk management processes, than\\r\\n     after-the-fact results.  In doing so, however, we must be assured\\r\\n     that with rare and circumscribed exceptions we do not substitute\\r\\n     supervisory judgments for management decisions.  That is the road\\r\\n     to moral hazard and inefficient bank management.  Fortunately,\\r\\n     the same technology and innovation that is driving supervisors to\\r\\n     focus on management processes will, through the development of\\r\\n     sophisticated market structures and responses, do much of our job\\r\\n     of ensuring safety and soundness.  We should be careful not to\\r\\n     impede the process.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBank supervisors play an important role in encouraging\\r\\n     the proper balance of risk-taking by developing prudent standards\\r\\n     and enforcing sound practices at banks.  Bill Taylor understood\\r\\n     that role and worked vigorously to address the weaknesses he saw.\\r\\n     The approach we take will convey our views regarding to what\\r\\n     extent governments will share banking risks and how much\\r\\n     responsibility rests with banks.  In a global financial system,\\r\\n     the choices we make will clearly have widespread effects.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nReturn to top\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n1996 Speeches\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHome | News and events \\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 23, 1996 12:00 PM\\n\\n\\n(function(){var js = \"window[\\'__CF$cv$params\\']={r:\\'7648c52ffd5c7144\\',m:\\'pfgmuUp799fTUuY4pPMyRGKd2UHEVtdY38cps6ysV_E-1667516889-0-AVAWSekAypC3vov9aLcNANL0PrwgnWS+UYDKKFBD6dDugFnWYER16GErQCiZIW1HgcxVIf1TYGJtqOyS+iVDRxdhG5Xa1C838kt5yqQ732awvI0HMzIiX+bogTljMat+GnFSQ/5SmJv2yUftWUfAlAXV5GJX+4iWunad43TVbST9\\',s:[0x80fc3774a1,0x3cbbe35826],u:\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g\\'};var now=Date.now()/1000,offset=14400,ts=\\'\\'+(Math.floor(now)-Math.floor(now%offset)),_cpo=document.createElement(\\'script\\');_cpo.nonce=\\'\\',_cpo.src=\\'/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/g/scripts/alpha/invisible.js?ts=\\'+ts,document.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_cpo);\";var _0xh = document.createElement(\\'iframe\\');_0xh.height = 1;_0xh.width = 1;_0xh.style.position = \\'absolute\\';_0xh.style.top = 0;_0xh.style.left = 0;_0xh.style.border = \\'none\\';_0xh.style.visibility = \\'hidden\\';document.body.appendChild(_0xh);function handler() {var _0xi = _0xh.contentDocument || _0xh.contentWindow.document;if (_0xi) {var _0xj = _0xi.createElement(\\'script\\');_0xj.nonce = \\'\\';_0xj.innerHTML = js;_0xi.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(_0xj);}}if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {handler();} else if (window.addEventListener) {document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', handler);} else {var prev = document.onreadystatechange || function () {};document.onreadystatechange = function (e) {prev(e);if (document.readyState !== \\'loading\\') {document.onreadystatechange = prev;handler();}};}})();'"

The recent publication of various survey results has\\r\\n\\r\\n     focused attention on the performance of the banking and\\r\\n\\r\\n     securities industries in educating customers about the critical\\r\\n\\r\\n     differences between FDIC-insured deposits and uninsured\\r\\n\\r\\n     investment products sold on bank premises.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Board has a long history of concerns about possible\\r\\n\\r\\n     customer confusion between insured deposit instruments and\\r\\n\\r\\n     uninsured investment products sold on bank premises.  We have\\r\\n\\r\\n     worked and continue to work diligently to minimize customer\\r\\n\\r\\n     confusion through a number of supervisory and educational\\r\\n\\r\\n     initiatives.  These initiatives include coordination among the\\r\\n\\r\\n     banking agencies to formulate clear and comprehensive guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n     governing the conduct of sales programs for nondeposit investment\\r\\n\\r\\n     products offered on bank premises; the development of detailed\\r\\n\\r\\n     examination procedures covering all aspects of sales of\\r\\n\\r\\n     nondeposit products; and the development and implementation of an\\r\\n\\r\\n     ambitious, multi-faceted education program for consumers and for\\r\\n\\r\\n     banks.  We also have developed a productive relationship with the\\r\\n\\r\\n     NASD that includes the coordination of examinations of bank\\r\\n\\r\\n     affiliated broker dealers and the sharing of examination\\r\\n\\r\\n     information in appropriate circumstances.  Finally, the banking\\r\\n\\r\\n     agencies and the securities self-regulatory organizations have\\r\\n\\r\\n     been working together to extend the same professional\\r\\n\\r\\n     qualification standards found in the securities industry to bank\\r\\n\\r\\n     sales personnel.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBefore discussing these matters in more detail, I believe it\\r\\n\\r\\n     would be helpful to discuss briefly the continuing growth of the\\r\\n\\r\\n     banking industry's sale of mutual funds and other nondeposit\\r\\n\\r\\n     investment products that has occurred since early 1994 when the\\r\\n\\r\\n     Board last testified on this subject.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nMutual Fund Sales\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     It is estimated that there were $3.1 trillion of mutual funds\\r\\n\\r\\n     outstanding as of April 1996, up by about 50 percent from year-\\r\\n\\r\\n     end 1994.  Of this amount, bank proprietary funds accounted for\\r\\n\\r\\n     about $420 billion, about 60 percent of which were money market\\r\\n\\r\\n     funds.  As you can see, the banking industry's share of total\\r\\n\\r\\n     mutual funds outstanding is relatively small, particularly when\\r\\n\\r\\n     money market funds are excluded.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nWith respect to sales volume, excluding money market funds,\\r\\n\\r\\n     banks sold about $32 billion of equity and debt funds in 1995, up\\r\\n\\r\\n     from $29 billion in 1994.  These uninsured investment products --\\r\\n\\r\\n     whose prices are most susceptible to changes in interest rates\\r\\n\\r\\n     and other market factors -- generate the most concern that\\r\\n\\r\\n     customers understand they could lose the principal that they\\r\\n\\r\\n     invested.  Over the years, the banking agencies have consistently\\r\\n\\r\\n     sought to protect and educate customers who might incorrectly\\r\\n\\r\\n     believe that such investments are insured deposit instruments.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nInteragency Statement\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In February 1994, the banking agencies jointly issued an\\r\\n\\r\\n     Interagency Statement on the Retail Sales of Nondeposit\\r\\n\\r\\n     Investment Products.  The Interagency  Statement calls for banks\\r\\n\\r\\n     selling such products on their premises to intensify their\\r\\n\\r\\n     disclosure efforts to advise retail customers that the\\r\\n\\r\\n     investments (i) are not deposits insured by the FDIC, (ii) are\\r\\n\\r\\n     not guaranteed by the bank and (iii) are subject to the risk of\\r\\n\\r\\n     loss of principal.  These three disclosures are quite similar to\\r\\n\\r\\n     those that have been required by the Federal Reserve since 1972\\r\\n\\r\\n     when it issued interpretations of Regulation Y pertaining to bank\\r\\n\\r\\n     holding company sales of uninsured investment instruments, such\\r\\n\\r\\n     as commercial paper.  Banks were required to provide disclosures\\r\\n\\r\\n     that were intended to enhance customer awareness and minimize the\\r\\n\\r\\n     mistaken notion that an investment product purchased on bank\\r\\n\\r\\n     premises was the same as an insured deposit.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe Interagency Statement also formalized the agencies'\\r\\n\\r\\n     expectation that sales of investment products would take place in\\r\\n\\r\\n     an area of the lobby distinctly separate from teller windows and\\r\\n\\r\\n     other locations where deposits could be made.   Moreover,\\r\\n\\r\\n     advertisements and account statements that contain information\\r\\n\\r\\n     about both insured deposits and uninsured investment products\\r\\n\\r\\n     must separate the information and provide the three disclosures I\\r\\n\\r\\n     mentioned earlier.  Appropriate standards for training,\\r\\n\\r\\n     compensation, suitability and supervision also were discussed.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nFinally, the Interagency Statement addressed the\\r\\n\\r\\n     relationship between banks and third parties that sell investment\\r\\n\\r\\n     products on bank premises -- by far the most typical scenario,\\r\\n\\r\\n     since approximately 87 percent of all sales on bank premises\\r\\n\\r\\n     occur through broker dealers.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nExamination Procedures\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Shortly after issuing the Interagency Statement, the Federal\\r\\n\\r\\n     Reserve developed detailed examination procedures for use in\\r\\n\\r\\n     state member banks that sell mutual funds to retail customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The procedures are intended to enhance the supervision of these\\r\\n\\r\\n     activities and to assure bank compliance with the guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n     contained in the Interagency Statement.  The procedures focus on\\r\\n\\r\\n     the adequacy of disclosure, the physical separation of securities\\r\\n\\r\\n     sales from deposit-taking activities, and other procedures\\r\\n\\r\\n     intended to avoid customer confusion and ensure customer\\r\\n\\r\\n     protection.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn the two years since their implementation, our examiners\\r\\n\\r\\n     have found that banks generally have procedures in place that\\r\\n\\r\\n     comply with the guidelines in the Interagency Statement.  In some\\r\\n\\r\\n     cases, examiners have identified material deficiencies in sales\\r\\n\\r\\n     programs and instructed that they be corrected.  Although the\\r\\n\\r\\n     Federal Reserve is prepared to initiate an enforcement action\\r\\n\\r\\n     against any bank found to operate a sales program in a manner not\\r\\n\\r\\n     consistent with principles of safety and soundness, in each case\\r\\n\\r\\n     in which problems were discovered, the bank responded promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In some cases this included a temporary suspension of sale\\r\\n\\r\\n     activities until deficiencies were corrected.  We have also found\\r\\n\\r\\n     many banks to be pro-active in their efforts to operate\\r\\n\\r\\n     investment sales programs in a safe and sound manner, and our\\r\\n\\r\\n     staff answers frequent inquiries concerning compliance with the\\r\\n\\r\\n     requirements of the Interagency Statement.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nNASD Coordination\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In January 1995, the banking agencies entered into an Agreement\\r\\n\\r\\n     in Principle with the NASD to coordinate the supervision and\\r\\n\\r\\n     examination of bank affiliated broker-dealers between the NASD\\r\\n\\r\\n     and the banking agencies.  In the interest of functional\\r\\n\\r\\n     supervision and to avoid duplicative efforts to supervise and\\r\\n\\r\\n     examine entities subject to the legal jurisdiction of both the\\r\\n\\r\\n     NASD and the banking agencies, arrangements were made to share\\r\\n\\r\\n     examination schedules, coordinate examinations and share\\r\\n\\r\\n     pertinent findings relevant to the retail securities sales\\r\\n\\r\\n     activities of such firms.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nPursuant to the Agreement, the Federal Reserve has worked\\r\\n\\r\\n     closely with the NASD on several occasions to address supervisory\\r\\n\\r\\n     issues arising from the examination of a state member bank and an\\r\\n\\r\\n     affiliated broker-dealer that conducts retail sales activities on\\r\\n\\r\\n     the bank's premises.  While the Federal Reserve has addressed the\\r\\n\\r\\n     issues with the bank to seek corrective action in response to the\\r\\n\\r\\n     problems, the NASD has addressed the matter with the affiliated\\r\\n\\r\\n     broker-dealer thereby assuring that all parties to the business\\r\\n\\r\\n     activity are responding to the supervisors' collective concerns.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nMost important, we have established effective lines of\\r\\n\\r\\n     communication and a cooperative working relationship with the\\r\\n\\r\\n     NASD.  We think that this relationship has made our supervisory\\r\\n\\r\\n     programs more effective.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nNASD Proposed Rulemaking\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In late 1994, the NASD proposed new rules governing sales of\\r\\n\\r\\n     securities on bank premises by member firms.  The Federal Reserve\\r\\n\\r\\n     worked with NASD staff and provided extensive comments on the\\r\\n\\r\\n     proposal, many of which were incorporated into its revised rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The NASD also relied on the expertise of the many commenters as\\r\\n\\r\\n     well as on the advice of a newly created committee of bank\\r\\n\\r\\n     affiliated broker-dealers and third party providers that sell\\r\\n\\r\\n     through banks.  The result is that the NASD's proposed rule now\\r\\n\\r\\n     is generally consistent with the Interagency Statement with\\r\\n\\r\\n     respect to the important issues of separation and disclosure.  We\\r\\n\\r\\n     informally have communicated with NASD representatives on issues,\\r\\n\\r\\n     such as use of confidential information, that need additional\\r\\n\\r\\n     clarification.  The extensive communication in connection with\\r\\n\\r\\n     this rulemaking demonstrates the commitment of both the industry\\r\\n\\r\\n     and the regulators to achieve consistency in rules and guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n     governing this area.  Our goal is to maximize the benefits and\\r\\n\\r\\n     minimize the burdens resulting from our joint jurisdiction in\\r\\n\\r\\n     this area.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBanking Agencies' Proposed Rulemaking on Professional\\r\\n\\r\\n     Qualifications\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The staff of the banking agencies is nearing completion of a\\r\\n\\r\\n     proposed rule to establish a professional qualifications program\\r\\n\\r\\n     for banks selling securities to retail customers that closely\\r\\n\\r\\n     follows securities industry requirements.  We believe the\\r\\n\\r\\n     establishment of professional qualification requirements is in\\r\\n\\r\\n     the best interests of the banking industry and of consumers.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nBriefly, the proposed rule would require bank employees to\\r\\n\\r\\n     take and pass a securities industry professional qualification\\r\\n\\r\\n     examination before beginning to sell securities to retail\\r\\n\\r\\n     customers.  This will ensure that bank securities representatives\\r\\n\\r\\n     are appropriately trained and educated as required by the\\r\\n\\r\\n     Interagency Statement, and will enhance the ability of banks to\\r\\n\\r\\n     serve their retail securities customers.  Continuing education\\r\\n\\r\\n     requirements, such as those required of broker dealers and their\\r\\n\\r\\n     employees, also would be imposed to assure continued familiarity\\r\\n\\r\\n     with industry practices, securities issues and regulatory\\r\\n\\r\\n     requirements.  Finally, bank sales personnel would be subject to\\r\\n\\r\\n     a registration process under which employment and certain\\r\\n\\r\\n     disciplinary and customer complaint information could be accessed\\r\\n\\r\\n     by members of the public.  The banking agencies are working with\\r\\n\\r\\n     the NASD to arrange for the NASD's new Central Registration\\r\\n\\r\\n     Depository to maintain registration information filed with the\\r\\n\\r\\n     banking agencies.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nIn our discussions with the trade organizations and industry\\r\\n\\r\\n     participants, we have encountered strong support for the proposed\\r\\n\\r\\n     rule.  We will encourage the banking industry to participate by\\r\\n\\r\\n     commenting on the proposal as the banking agencies work closely\\r\\n\\r\\n     with the securities self regulatory organizations to bring this\\r\\n\\r\\n     proposal to fruition.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nMarket Trends Survey\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The FDIC recently released the results of its market trends\\r\\n\\r\\n     survey which show that some banks and securities firms selling on\\r\\n\\r\\n     bank premises need to improve their efforts to advise customers\\r\\n\\r\\n     of the risks associated with nondeposit investment products.  We\\r\\n\\r\\n     agree.  While there have been various consumer surveys that have\\r\\n\\r\\n     shown an increasing awareness among the investing public that\\r\\n\\r\\n     mutual funds and other investment products purchased at banks are\\r\\n\\r\\n     not FDIC insured, more can be done.  For those investors who do\\r\\n\\r\\n     not understand the risks associated with the lack of FDIC\\r\\n\\r\\n     insurance, point-of-sale disclosures remain important.  In this\\r\\n\\r\\n     regard, the Federal Reserve is working closely with the other\\r\\n\\r\\n     federal banking agencies to promote disclosure by banks through\\r\\n\\r\\n     the examination process, promote greater consumer understanding\\r\\n\\r\\n     through education, and promote professional qualification\\r\\n\\r\\n     standards for bank sales personnel.  We also will continue to\\r\\n\\r\\n     work with the NASD to obtain further improvements in disclosure\\r\\n\\r\\n     by broker dealers selling securities on banks premises.  As I\\r\\n\\r\\n     noted earlier, approximately 87 percent of all securities sold on\\r\\n\\r\\n     bank premises are through sales representatives of NASD\\r\\n\\r\\n     registered broker dealers.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nEducation Initiatives\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     In an effort to help bank customers understand that not all\\r\\n\\r\\n     products sold at banks are insured by the federal government, the\\r\\n\\r\\n     Federal Reserve launched a multi-dimensional, national education\\r\\n\\r\\n     program designed to deliver this message to consumers.  In\\r\\n\\r\\n     addition to the Interagency Statement, for the past 18 months,\\r\\n\\r\\n     the Federal Reserve has been engaged in an intensive education\\r\\n\\r\\n     program aimed at both retail customers and bankers.  Mutual\\r\\n\\r\\n     Funds:  Understand the Risks, as the program is known, is quite\\r\\n\\r\\n     comprehensive.  It includes material for both a consumer seminar\\r\\n\\r\\n     presentation and a banker compliance program; a video that can be\\r\\n\\r\\n     used by bankers and other professionals in their dealings with\\r\\n\\r\\n     retail customers; and compliance checklists to help bankers\\r\\n\\r\\n     operate in a manner that complies with the Interagency Statement.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThe goal of the consumer seminar program is to help retail\\r\\n\\r\\n     customers understand the differences between insured deposits and\\r\\n\\r\\n     uninsured investments; the goal of the banker education program\\r\\n\\r\\n     is to increase compliance with the Interagency Statement, which\\r\\n\\r\\n     in turn will help inform and protect customers.  The program has\\r\\n\\r\\n     been well received and has been discussed in numerous\\r\\n\\r\\n     publications.  The American Bankers Association has featured the\\r\\n\\r\\n     program in its newsletter and has broadcast the video on its\\r\\n\\r\\n     Skylink System.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nTo date, 70 consumer seminars and 47 banker training\\r\\n\\r\\n     programs have been held around the country, reaching over 7,500\\r\\n\\r\\n     consumers -- including a seminar in Spanish to an audience in\\r\\n\\r\\n     Puerto Rico -- and nearly 1400 bankers.  Materials have been\\r\\n\\r\\n     distributed to another 3,150 consumers via exhibits and town\\r\\n\\r\\n     meetings sponsored by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Nearly 10,000 copies of the video, over 7,000 copies of the\\r\\n\\r\\n     compliance checklists, and approximately 1,500 copies of the\\r\\n\\r\\n     consumer outreach package have been distributed.  The materials\\r\\n\\r\\n     have been shared with federal and state regulators and are\\r\\n\\r\\n     available from the Board.  Selected materials have been\\r\\n\\r\\n     translated into Spanish.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nThese seminars and educational initiatives appear to work.\\r\\n\\r\\n     A comparison of knowledge levels before and after a consumer\\r\\n\\r\\n     seminar indicates that individuals seem to have a better\\r\\n\\r\\n     understanding of the risks associated with nondeposit investment\\r\\n\\r\\n     products: 91 percent know these products are not FDIC insured,\\r\\n\\r\\n     compared to 65 percent prior to the seminar; 87 percent know\\r\\n\\r\\n     these products carry the risk of loss of principal, compared to\\r\\n\\r\\n     72 percent prior to the seminar.  Bankers who attended our\\r\\n\\r\\n     training sessions report that they feel better able to comply\\r\\n\\r\\n     with the Interagency Statement, especially with respect to\\r\\n\\r\\n     disclosure and the physical separation of the investment sales\\r\\n\\r\\n     area from deposit taking activities.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nWe intend to do more.  We have completed a video public\\r\\n\\r\\n     service announcement that will be distributed this summer to 145\\r\\n\\r\\n     stations in the top forty national television markets.  Materials\\r\\n\\r\\n     for the bankers training program are currently being updated and\\r\\n\\r\\n     we hope to soon initiate another round of banker education\\r\\n\\r\\n     programs.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     The continuing growth in bank sales of mutual funds and other\\r\\n\\r\\n     uninsured investments necessitates a commitment on the part of\\r\\n\\r\\n     the banking industry and bank supervisors to the principle that\\r\\n\\r\\n     effective disclosure of risks is in the best interest of the\\r\\n\\r\\n     customer and the banking organization.  Banks can best assure\\r\\n\\r\\n     that their sales staffs are operating in a manner consistent with\\r\\n\\r\\n     this objective if they develop comprehensive training programs\\r\\n\\r\\n     and effectively monitor compliance with policies and procedures\\r\\n\\r\\n     governing sales of nondeposit products.  The Federal Reserve will\\r\\n\\r\\n     continue to seek ways to strengthen its educational and\\r\\n\\r\\n     supervisory programs to promote compliance with the guidelines in\\r\\n\\r\\n     the Interagency Statement, so that bank customers are served in a\\r\\n\\r\\n     safe and sound manner consistent with principles of customer\\r\\n\\r\\n     protection.\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\nReturn to top\\n\\n[SECTION]\\n\\n1996 Testimony\\n\\n\\n\\nHome | News and events \\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\n\\nLast update: June 26, 1996, 12:00 PM\""
