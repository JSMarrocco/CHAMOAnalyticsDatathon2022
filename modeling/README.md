# Modeling

**Directories**:
- `DNN`: all code related to experimentation/training/evaluation for a simple DNN we built
- `lstm`: all code related to experimentation/training/evaluation for a LSTM NN we built
- `transformer`: all code related to experimentation/training/evaluation for a transformer model

**Files**
- `ensemble.ipynb`: the **final model**, which is an ensemble. See this file for final reslults. It loads models generated by the notebooks in the model directories and average their predictions.
